                        An ocean is a continuous body of salt water that is contained in enormous basins on Earth’s surface.
                        <br><br>
                        When viewed from space, the predominance of Earth’s oceans is readily apparent. The oceans and their marginal seas cover nearly 71 percent of Earth’s surface, with an average depth of 3,688 metres (12,100 feet). The exposed land occupies the remaining 29 percent of the planetary surface and has a mean elevation of about 840 metres (approximately 2,755 feet). Actually, all the elevated land could be hidden under the oceans and Earth reduced to a smooth sphere that would be completely covered by a continuous layer of seawater more than 2,600 metres (8,530 feet) deep. This is known as the sphere depth of the oceans and serves to underscore the abundance of water on Earth’s surface.

                        Pacific Ocean, body of salt water extending from the 60° S parallel in the south to the Arctic in the north and lying between the continents of Asia and Australia on the west and North America and South America on the east.

                        Of the three major oceans, the Pacific is by far the largest, occupying about one-third of the surface of the globe. Its area, excluding the South China Sea, encompasses about 62.5 million square miles (161.76 million square km). It has double the area and more than double the water volume of the Atlantic Ocean—the next largest division of the hydrosphere—and its area more than exceeds that of the whole land surface of the globe. The Pacific Ocean stretches from the Bering Strait to 60° S latitude through more than 120° of latitude, nearly 9,000 miles (about 14,500 km). Its greatest latitudinal extent measures some 12,000 miles (about 19,000 km) along latitude 5° N, between the coasts of Colombia in South America and the Malay Peninsula in Asia. The mean depth of the Pacific (excluding adjacent seas) is 14,040 feet (4,280 metres), and its greatest known depth is 36,201 feet (11,034 metres)—in the Mariana Trench—also the greatest depth found in any ocean.

                        In the Northern Hemisphere the Pacific Ocean meets the Arctic Ocean in the Bering Sea. In the Southern Hemisphere the Pacific and Atlantic mix in the relatively narrow Drake Passage between Tierra del Fuego in South America and Graham Land in Antarctica, and the Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean meet at the 60° S parallel. The separation between the Pacific and Indian oceans is less distinct, but generally it is considered to lie along the line of islands extending eastward from Sumatra, through Java to Timor, thence across the Timor Sea to Cape Londonderry in Australia. To the south of Australia the boundary extends across the Bass Strait and thence from Tasmania to 60° S.
                        <br><br>
                        Because of the pattern of major mountain systems of the globe, a relatively small proportion (one-seventh) of the total continental drainage enters the Pacific—a total drainage area of less than about three times the total area of Australia. <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/eastasiadrainagetopacific.png" alt="eastasiadrainagetopacific" class="right">Of the rivers that drain into the Pacific, those of China and Southeast Asia are of the greatest importance; the basins of those rivers support more than one-fourth of the world’s population.
                        <br><br>
                        The eastern boundary of the Pacific is associated with the American cordilleran system, which stretches from Alaska in the north to Tierra del Fuego in the south. Except for its extreme northern and southern sections, which are characterized by fjords and their numerous off-lying islands, and except for the deeply indented Gulf of California, the coastal boundary is relatively regular and the continental shelf narrow. The western, or Asiatic, coastal boundary, in contrast, is irregular. Although the mountain systems there lie roughly parallel to the coast, as they do on the eastern Pacific coastlands, the western Pacific is noted for its many marginal seas. From north to south they include the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan (East Sea), the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea. Their eastern boundaries are formed by southward-jutting peninsulas or island arcs or both. It is of oceanographic significance that the great rivers of eastern Asia—including the Amur, the Huang He (Yellow River), the Yangtze, the Xi and Pearl (Zhu), and the Mekong—enter the Pacific indirectly by way of the marginal seas.

                    <dd>
                        The eastern Pacific region, which extends southward from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, is relatively narrow and is associated with the American cordilleran system of almost unbroken mountain chains, the coastal ranges of which rise steeply from the western shores of North and South America. The continental shelf, which runs parallel to it, is narrow, while the adjacent continental slope is very steep. Significant oceanic trenches in this region are the Middle America Trench in the North Pacific and the Peru-Chile Trench in the South Pacific.
                        <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/tectonic_setting_middle_american_trench_opt.png" alt="Asian Flags" class="full">
                        <br><br>
                        The seaward boundary of the western Pacific region is marked by a broken line of oceanic trenches, extending from the Aleutian Trench in the north through the Kuril and Japan trenches and southward to the Tonga and Kermadec trenches, terminating close to the northeast of North Island, New Zealand. Its structure is more complex than that of the eastern region. Characteristically associated with the ocean trenches of the western region are festoons of either peninsulas or islands or both. The islands, which include those of Japan as well as numerous smaller islands, represent the upper parts of mountain systems that rise abruptly from the deep ocean floor. The island clusters of the western Pacific form the boundaries of the several wide and deep continental seas of the region.

                        The Pacific has the most varied <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/laminariapacific.jpg" alt="Laminaria" class="right">array of plants (algae) and animals of the world’s oceans. The circumglobal mixing of water in the southern and, to a much more limited extent, northern polar reaches of the Pacific permits the intermingling of flora and fauna from other oceanic regions, while temperate and tropical surface waters of the Pacific are more likely to have indigenous biotas. On the rocky cold-water coasts of North and South America, for example, are found vast forestlike kelp beds made up of brown algae of the genus Laminaria, with individual plants often reaching heights of 100 feet (30 metres) or more. They harbour a rich animal complement of invertebrates and fishes approaching a faunal variety that vies with that of tropical rainforests. Where upwelling and other current conditions add nutrients to the offshore surface waters of these same reaches of the Pacific, dense concentrations of plankton-feeding fishes thrive, predominantly those of the herring family and its relatives. Examples include the Japanese sardine and the Peruvian anchovy, both of which are among the largest single-species fishing catches in the world.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/Oncorhynchus.jpg" alt="Oncorhynchus" class="left">
                        In the North Pacific the circulation patterns and runoff from the land create conditions in which demersal, or bottom-living, species abound. The North Pacific hake and the Alaska pollock are prominent examples. Salmon likewise thrive in the North Pacific, proliferating there in five species of the genus Oncorhynchus, as compared with the single species, Salmo salar, of the Atlantic.
                        <br><br>
                        In the warm tropical region—roughly between the North and South Equatorial Current systems—the wealth of marine animals especially increases dramatically. The variety of animal life is greater in the western Pacific, where the warm monsoonal climate and variegated landforms have promoted evolution of the unique Indo-Pacific marine forms. <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/philippineswesternpacific.jpg" alt="Philippines, Southeast Asia, western Pacific Ocean" class="full"> The western Pacific also has the richest and most extensive coral reefs of any ocean, with some six times more species of fish associated with them than with the coral reefs of the Caribbean Sea in the Atlantic. The tropical sea passages between the Pacific and the Indian oceans have also given the latter ocean a rich reef fauna; Indo-Pacific mollusks have reached copious evolutionary diversification, with the giant clam, Tridacna gigas, a spectacular example. Another example of the Pacific’s richness in species is found among the tunas: six species (one of them endemic) roam the tropical reaches of the Pacific, furnishing more than half of the world’s tuna catch.
                        <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/whale-shark-mating-secret-featured.jpg" alt="full">
                        <br><br>
                        Whales are a prominent and spectacular component of the Pacific marine biota. The habits of many species include regular long-distance migrations from cold-water feeding to warm-water breeding and calving grounds, thus predisposing them to global distribution.

                    <dd>
                        Because of the biological richness of certain reaches of the Pacific and because of the large human populations in many of the countries bordering it, the catches there are substantially larger than those in the other oceans and comprise the bulk of the total world catch. Among Pacific countries, Japan and Russia have the largest fisheries in the world as measured by tonnage caught, but China, the United States, Peru, Chile, South Korea, and Indonesia are also among the world’s major fishing countries. The fishing industries in all of these countries are enormous, and all are based at least in part on fisheries in the Pacific. A number of species—including sardines, herring, anchovies, hake, pollock, and shrimp—have been fished in some areas up to, if not beyond, the limits of their sustainable yields.
                        <br><br>
                        Salmon fisheries are important in the United States, Japan, Russia, and Canada, while the fishing quests for tuna have particular significance for the small island countries of the Pacific. The fishing for these species is done mostly by the technologically advanced vessels of Japan, the United States, South Korea, and Taiwan. Many of the tuna are found within the 200-nautical-mile (370-km) exclusive economic zones of the island countries, giving them the opportunity to exact fees for fishing rights and to develop tuna fisheries and processing facilities.
                        <br><br>
                        Increasing population pressure, along with economic and industrial development in several coastal regions of the Pacific, has led to overfishing and impairment of habitat for a number of coastal species. Aquaculture is increasingly supplementing the natural supply. Shrimp, edible and pearl oysters, salmon, sea bream, mullet, and groupers are among the Pacific fauna that have been raised successfully.
                        <br><br>
                        In the tropical Pacific, prized corals have long been harvested from great depths. Pink coral species come mainly from the western Hawaiian atolls; black coral is also extracted from Hawaiian coral beds, from shallow seamounts, and from Malaysian and Indonesian waters.

                    <dt><h3>East Asia</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The monsoonal climate in East Asia brings hot and rainy summers, giving rise to a great variety of temperate and tropical vegetation. China has the most varied vegetation of any country in the world, with about 30,000 species, excluding mushrooms and mosses. The enormous variety of plants, which includes a large number of relict forest species, is explained by the negligible impact that Pleistocene glaciations had on the region’s climate. 

                        About two-thirds of Japan’s total area is forested, whereas much of China is deforested (roughly one-seventh of China is under forest cover); sizable tracts remain untouched, however, in the remote rugged regions of China, and many small areas have been reforested. One reason for that difference between the two countries is the traditional respect the Japanese have had for their scenery and, consequently, the strict forestry regulations that have been promulgated and enforced. In addition, the rugged topography and inaccessibility of many of Japan’s forested areas have limited the possibilities for economic exploitation. The best examples of East Asian forest, therefore, are found in Japan, such as in the Kii Peninsula of Honshu.

                        North of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang), much of China was once covered by primeval deciduous forest, most of which has been removed to create farmland. South of the Yangtze, the “true” Chinese forest was prevalent before 1800. A wild growth of trees and shrubs survives, however, throughout the cultivated areas, and parklike tree growth and stands of bamboo are widespread. The original forest cover included 60 different genera of tall trees; among the temperate genera were oak, maple, linden, chestnut, hornbeam, and a species of hickory, and among the tropical genera were magnolia, the tulip tree, the camphor tree, the Spanish cedar, sweet gum, catalpa, and lianas (vines). A variety of conifers of both hemispheres also occurred there, and in the mountains of eastern Sichuan there grew a rare and ancient Chinese conifer, the dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides). Palm trees are found throughout South China and southern South Korea, as well as in the southern parts of Japan; many varieties of bamboo also are found in those regions. China has been proceeding energetically with a program of reforestation. The new forests, however, consisting largely of pines, do not resemble the primeval forests.

                    <dt><h3>South and Southeast Asia</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The wettest parts of peninsular India (such as the Western Ghats) and of Southeast Asia have magnificent tropical forests noteworthy for the variety of their plant life. A significant feature of South Asian vegetation is the family Dipterocarpaceae (yielding aromatic oils and resins), which is represented there by more than 500 species. In parts of peninsular India and Southeast Asia that have a seasonal monsoon climate (with four to eight dry months per year), moist- and dry-deciduous forests thrive. Many of the tree species, such as teak, sal, and sandalwood, are highly valuable and are heavily exploited. In areas with a prolonged dry season and less precipitation (e.g., northwestern India, the interior of the Deccan plateau, and the “dry zone” of Myanmar [Burma]), savanna woodland and thorny thickets of acacias and euphorbias are the predominant natural vegetation. In all of the major climate zones of South and Southeast Asia, and particularly on the alluvial plains, much of the natural vegetation has been cleared to make way for agriculture.

                        Mangrove swamps thrive in the sheltered muddy coasts and deltas. Their outermost edges are represented by species of Rhizophora (red mangrove), followed by those of Bruguiera and Avicennia (white mangrove). The bogs on the landward edges of those swamps abound with the semiaquatic nipa palm.

                        Primeval evergreen rainforest remains in a few parts of South and Southeast Asia. Secondary forest covers a much larger area. The once universally dense forest has given way to parklike forest and wooded savanna as a result of intensive grazing, tree harvesting, and shifting (slash-and-burn) agricultural practices. Extensive fires in such areas have produced a herbaceous landscape, as in the cogonales (areas of coarse tall grasses, used for thatching) of the Philippines.

                        Hevea brasiliensis, the rubber tree introduced into tropical Asia from South America in the 1870s, is particularly important in plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia.

                        In the higher mountains of Southeast Asia, the cooler humid-tropical climate gives rise to deciduous and coniferous temperate forest at elevations of between about 4,250 and 10,000 feet (1,300 and 3,000 metres). Above that level low forests of plants, mostly shrubs of the heath family, are often found. Diverse types of trees grow in the mountain forests of the region. The Rakhine (Arakan) Mountains of Myanmar, for example, are covered with a thick mantle of little bamboos. In the eastern Himalayas sal is intermingled with Castanopsis (a small genus of nut-bearing trees) and pines. Above those are found forests of shrubs and trees of the laurel family and, higher still, oaks and conifers; between about 10,000 and 13,000 feet (3,000 and 4,000 metres), forests of firs occur. The central Himalayas present strikingly beautiful landscapes in the following upward succession: dry sal forest; pine forest; cedars, spruces, pines, and oaks; firs, birches, and tall rhododendrons; rhododendron bushes and junipers above 13,000 feet (4,000 metres); and perpetual snows above 16,000 feet (4,900 metres).

                    <dt><h3>West Asia</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        In West Asia naturally wild vegetation no longer occurs in clearly defined zones but is dispersed in small areas. The region is predominantly arid; desertlike depressions such as the Kyzylkum Desert of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the Karakum Desert of Turkmenistan, and the Rubʿ al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of the Arabian Peninsula contrast with the moist, forested mountains that lie between them. Three climatic zones, however, characterize West Asia: a continental climate in the northern regions; a dry zone, except where northerly winds bring moisture to the mountains, to the south; and a Mediterranean climate along the western edges.

                        A few examples of the variety of vegetation associated with those climatic zones may be cited. In the Karakum Desert grows a strange xerophytic tree, the saxaul, which is oddly shaped, gnarled, and leafless; it is widely used for firewood, and its young sprouts make excellent fodder for camels. Between the galleries of saxauls the desert is interspersed at wide intervals with bushes and tufts of grass. A fringe of steppe covers the area between the Fertile Crescent (which sweeps in an arc from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean) and the north and west of the Syrian Desert. With more than 2,000 species of plants—more than in the whole of the Sahara—the borders of the Syrian Desert are noteworthy for their floral variety. The moist northern slopes of the Pontic Mountains in northern Turkey are covered by magnificent forests of beeches and conifers, with an undergrowth of tall cherry laurels, hollies, and creepers. That type of forest is also found in Georgia and on the northern slopes of the Elburz Mountains in Iran. Along the Mediterranean border of Asia, the natural vegetation is similar to that in other parts of the Mediterranean region: holm oak (an evergreen oak), Aleppo pine (used in shipbuilding), cistus, mastic tree (which yields mastic, an aromatic resin), and other species are found in landscapes of thick underbrush and open scrubland. Extensive forests, with such species as the cedar of Lebanon, once grew in that region, but logging and heavy grazing by livestock have reduced many once-forested areas to grassland and scrubland.

                        Minerals are extracted from the seawater itself, from offshore alluvial deposits, or from within the continental shelf and may be metallic or nonmetallic; hydrocarbon fuels are the most valuable among the latter. Also prominent in the Pacific are deepwater metallic mineral deposits of potential economic significance. Fresh water is also obtained from the ocean by various methods of desalination, as is done in Japan.

                    <dd>
                        Common salt (sodium chloride) is the most important mineral obtained directly from seawater. Mexico leads the Pacific countries in salt extraction from the sea, mostly by solar evaporation. Bromine extracted from seawater is used in the food, dye, pharmaceutical, and photo industries. The United States and China lead in its production among Pacific riparian countries. Magnesium, recovered by an electrolytic process, is used in industrial metal alloys, especially with aluminum; China has become the main site for its production.

                        Also important are the sand and gravel extracted from the shallow sea bottom. Japan has been a major Pacific producer, but Pacific countries in North America have also relied on offshore sand and gravel. Sand and gravel mining from the seabed is important in nearly all Pacific countries.

                        Large submarine deposits of phosphate rock (phosphorite) are found in the Pacific off the coasts of Peru, eastern Australia, and California and on the Chatham Rise east of New Zealand. Smaller deposits also occur in lagoons of some of the Pacific Islands. Only a few of these phosphorite deposits are of economic significance.

                        Metal-bearing deposits on the deep-sea floor, consisting of nodules, crusts, and accumulations of metallic sulfides from deep vents, are of potential economic interest. In the 1970s and ’80s it was hoped that mining the nodules—which contain quantities of manganese, iron, copper, nickel, titanium, and cobalt, as well as small traces of other metals—might be a way to contribute to the wealth of newly industrializing countries. Economic considerations and concern over management of mining operations, however, have slowed exploration and development of underwater mining technology.

                        Marine sulfide ores, containing iron, copper, cobalt, zinc, and traces of other metallic elements, are deposited in large amounts by the actions of deepwater hydrothermal vents, such as occur in the Pacific off the Galapagos Islands and on the Juan de Fuca and Gorda ridges in the Okinawa Trough and in the Manus Basin off New Guinea.

                        Deposits of petroleum and natural gas under the seafloor are the most valuable and sought-after fuels of the contemporary world economy. Shallow seas and small ocean basins, such as the South and East China seas, have notable reserves, but exploitation of some deposits has been hindered by territorial disputes. Among the countries bordering the Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas, the proportion of production from submarine reserves varies widely, from less than half in Indonesia and Japan to nearly all in Australia and Malaysia.

                        The principal areas in the southwestern Pacific for offshore oil and gas exploration are in the South China Sea—the waters off Vietnam and off Hainan Island in China and on the continental shelf northwest of the island of Palawan in the Philippines—but they also include the area off Natuna Islands and some areas off the Sumatran coast in Indonesia. In the northwestern Pacific the main areas lie to the northwest of the island of Kyushu in Japan, in the southern portion of the Yellow Sea and in the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli), and in regions off Sakhalin Island and the Kamchatka Peninsula. Oil and gas wells have been drilled in the Bering Sea in the north and in areas off the coast of southern California in the eastern Pacific. In the southern Pacific, hydrocarbon production and exploration is taking place off northwestern and northern Australia and in the Gippsland Basin off southeast Australia.

                        Atlantic Ocean, body of salt water covering approximately one-fifth of Earth’s surface and separating the continents of Europe and Africa to the east from those of North and South America to the west. The ocean’s name, derived from Greek mythology, means the “Sea of Atlas.” It is second in size to the Pacific Ocean.
                        <br><br>
                        The Atlantic is, generally speaking, S-shaped and narrow in relation to its length. The area of the Atlantic without its dependent seas is approximately 31,568,000 square miles (81,760,000 square km), and with them its area is about 32,870,000 square miles (85,133,000 square km). It has an average depth (with its seas) of 11,962 feet (3,646 metres) and a maximum depth of 27,493 feet (8,380 metres) in the Puerto Rico Trench, north of the island of Puerto Rico.
                        <br><br>
                        The ocean’s breadth from east to west varies considerably. Between Newfoundland and Ireland it is about 2,060 miles (3,320 km); farther south it widens to more than 3,000 miles (4,800 km) before narrowing again so that the distance from Cape São Roque, Brazil, to Cape Palmas, Liberia, is only some 1,770 miles (2,850 km). Southward it again becomes broader and is bordered by simple coasts almost without islands; between Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope the ocean approaches its border with the Southern Ocean at 60° S latitude on a broad front nearly 3,200 miles (about 5,200 km) wide.
                        <br><br>
                        Although not the largest of the world’s oceans, the Atlantic has by far the largest drainage area. The continents on both sides of the Atlantic tend to slope toward it, so that it receives the waters of a great proportion of the major rivers of the world; these include the St. Lawrence, the Mississippi, the Orinoco, the Amazon, the Río de la Plata, the Congo, the Niger, the Loire, the Rhine, the Elbe, and the great rivers draining into the Mediterranean, Black, and Baltic seas. In contrast to the South Atlantic, the North Atlantic is rich in islands, in the variety of its coastline, and in tributary seas. The latter include the Caribbean Sea, the Gulfs of Mexico and St. Lawrence, and Hudson and Baffin bays on the west and the Baltic, North, Mediterranean, and Black seas on the east.

                        Various boundaries have been used to define particularly the northern but also the southern limits of the Atlantic Ocean. There are no universally accepted boundary conventions. In the north the situation is further complicated by the fact that the Arctic Ocean frequently is considered to be a dependent sea of the Atlantic. This is because the Arctic basin—which stretches from the Bering Strait across the North Pole to Spitsbergen and Greenland—resembles a semienclosed basin (i.e., it is nearly surrounded by land, receives proportionately large volumes of river discharge and sediments, has an extensive continental margin, and is relatively shallow). In this article, however, the Arctic Ocean is considered a separate entity.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/atlanticarctic.png" alt="atlanticarctic" class="full">
                        Attempts to define the open-water boundary between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans often rely on arbitrary latitude coordinates or linear transects; the two most common latitudinal boundaries are 65° N and the Arctic Circle (66°30′ N). A less arbitrary method involves drawing a line eastward from Greenland to Iceland along the shallow Greenland-Iceland Rise and from Iceland to the Faroe Islands along the Faroe-Iceland Rise and then northward from the Faroes along the relatively shallow bottom features of the Voring Plateau to the west coast of Norway at a point near 70° N. Perhaps a more appropriate method for determining this boundary is by following the division between the distinctive Arctic and Atlantic water masses: the relatively warm and saline waters of the Norwegian Sea are assigned to the Atlantic, and the cold, lower-salinity waters of the Greenland Sea to the Arctic.
                        <br><br>
                        There is less ambiguity about the southern boundaries of the Atlantic Ocean, although the name Southern Ocean has been given to the waters south of 60° S latitude that surround Antarctica. The most widely accepted limit between the South Atlantic and Indian oceans is a line that runs south from Cape Agulhas, at the southern tip of Africa, along the 20° E meridian to the 60° S parallel. Similarly, the boundary dividing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans passes through the Drake Passage between Cape Horn at the tip of South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.

                    <dt><h3>Relief of the ocean floor</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The outstanding feature of the Atlantic floor is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an immense median mountain range extending throughout the length of the Atlantic, claiming the centre third of the ocean bed, and reaching roughly 1,000 miles (1,600 km) in breadth. This feature, though of tremendous proportions, is but the Atlantic portion of the world-encircling oceanic ridge.
                        <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/atlanticrelief.jpg" alt="atlanticrelief" class="full">
                        <br><br>
                        In some places the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reaches above sea level to form islands. Iceland, which rises from its crest, is rent by an extension of the median rift valley. East and west of the ridge, about 12,000 to 18,000 feet (3,700 to 5,500 metres) below sea level, lie basins that seem to present a relatively even profile, but parts of the basin floor are as mountainous as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, while other parts are extremely smooth. The former are rocky abyssal hills; the latter are the abyssal plains that form the upper surface of great ponds of mud that fill many of the broad depressions. Large ancient volcanoes are found singly or in rows in the basins; these rise to form seamounts and, occasionally, islands.
                        <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/midatlanticridge.png" alt="midatlanticridge" class="full">
                        <br><br>
                        As the continents are approached and the rugged Mid-Atlantic Ridge is left behind, an abyssal plain first is encountered, followed by the smooth, undulating surface of the continental rise. These broad embankments, which lie at depths of some 8,000 to 15,000 feet (2,400 to 4,500 metres) at the foot of continents, reach more than 300 miles (500 km) in width off northwestern Africa, Angola, Argentina, and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. In other areas they are exceedingly narrow. Millions of years of weathering, erosion, and riverine sediment deposition have contributed to creating the sloping continental rises that are characteristic of the Atlantic basin. It is beneath these slopes—in accumulations 10,000 to 50,000 feet (3,000 to 15,000 metres) thick—that some of the largest potential reserves on Earth of petroleum, natural gas, and coal are found.
                        <br><br>
                        The Lesser Antilles and the South Sandwich Islands form large unstable island arcs, where the greatest depths of the Atlantic are found in steep-sided, narrow gashes that drop to more than 25,000 feet (7,600 metres) below sea level and more than 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) below the floors of adjacent basins. Depths greater than 13,000 feet (4,000 metres) occur in the Caribbean basin, which has numerous shallow and several deep connections with the open ocean, and in a few parts of the Mediterranean Sea, which communicates with the Atlantic only through the Strait of Gibraltar. The strait is about 8 miles (13 km) wide at its narrowest point, and the maximum depth on its sill (submarine ridge between basins) is only a little more than 1,000 feet (300 metres). The partial isolation of the large seas adjacent to the Mediterranean has a profound effect on the conditions in the seas themselves as well as in the open ocean.

                        Among purely oceanic islands (i.e., those without any foundation of continental rock, usually formed as the result of volcanic action) are Iceland, the Azores, Ascension, St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha, Bouvet, and Gough, which all rise from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; and the Canary, Madeira, and Cape Verde islands and Fernando de Noronha (near Cape São Roque), which rise from the continental margins of Africa and South America. Volcanic islands of a different sort are those of the two great arcs: the Lesser Antilles and the South Sandwich Islands. Partly continental and partly oceanic are the Greater Antilles in the Caribbean and South Georgia and the South Orkney Islands in the Scotia Sea. Purely continental are the British Isles, Newfoundland, the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), and Greenland, which is an extension of the Canadian Shield.

                        The great north-south extent, relatively broad areas of continental shelf, proportionally large runoff from land, and circulation patterns are all factors that have given the Atlantic a proliferation of plant (i.e., algae) and animal species that is second only to that of the Pacific among the world’s oceans. A large variety of seaweeds inhabit the shallower continental margins and coastal areas, particularly in the North Atlantic. Algae of commercial value include the kelp genus Laminaria, a source of iodine, potassium, and algin; Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), from which carrageenan is derived; and such edible varieties as dulse (Rhodymenia palmata) and laver (Porphyra). Also of note in the North Atlantic are the huge masses of gulfweed (Sargassum natans) in the Sargasso Sea, which support large communities of crustaceans and fish normally associated with coastal regions and which are the spawning grounds for the American and European freshwater eels of the genus Anguilla.

                        The areas of coastal upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich deep water—especially off western Africa, in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the waters surrounding Iceland, and off the coasts of southeastern South America and southern Africa—are the sites of large plankton blooms, which in turn are the basis of much of the Atlantic’s rich fish life. The greatest concentrations of plankton are found in the North Atlantic. In tropical regions, plankton production is fairly constant throughout the year, whereas with increasing latitude it becomes tied to the availability of sunlight and results in explosive and relatively short-lived blooms.

                        In addition to fish, the Atlantic is home to a variety of sponges, sea anemones, horseshoe crabs, mollusks, and sea turtles. Coral reefs are confined largely to the Caribbean and do not approach those of the Pacific in the diversity of their reef life. Marine mammals consist primarily of dolphins and dwindling numbers of manatees in tropical regions and harp seals in the northwest of the basin. Whales generally are restricted to the cool-temperate and Antarctic regions of the South Atlantic, although many species migrate to tropical waters to breed.

                        The Atlantic’s major fishing grounds—representing more than half the world’s total—long were the most productive and most heavily utilized of all the oceans. For some time, many Atlantic species have been intensively fished, and some key populations are thought to be at or near collapse. While the total global marine catch increased steadily over the second half of the 20th century, that for the Atlantic remained fairly constant. Consequently, the Atlantic’s share of the overall marine catch dropped from more than half in the 1950s to roughly one-fifth by the time the global catch leveled off in the early 21st century.
                        <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/atlantic-ocean-species-fish-underwater-photography-south-east-florida-32419076.jpg" alt="schooloffish" class="full">
                        <br><br>
                        The Atlantic continues to provide millions of tons of fish annually for human consumption and industrial purposes. Nearly all of the Atlantic fish catch is taken from waters of the continental shelf, primarily from the nutrient-rich areas, where upwellings occur. Among the important commercial fish taken in the North Atlantic are the demersal (deep-dwelling) species such as lobster and members of the Gadidae (cod) family—notably haddock and cod—and such pelagic (free-swimming) species as lobster, mackerel, herring, and menhaden. Important commercial shellfish species include sea scallops, surf clams, ocean quahogs, and blue mussels. In the Gulf of Mexico and in equatorial regions, shrimp, shellfish, and eels are harvested in quantities. Hake, tuna, and pilchard are key commercial species in the South Atlantic, despite severe depletion of the latter two stocks.
                        <br><br>
                        Many Atlantic countries have been attempting to protect—with limited success—their living resources by managing the level of fishing activity in their territorial waters and 200-nautical-mile (370-kilometre) exclusive economic zones. Methods used have included area closures, permits, catch limits and quotas, and time and season restrictions.
                        <br><br>
                        The United Nations has reviewed the status of fish stocks in its six major Atlantic Ocean fishing regions. Except for the southwest Atlantic region, for which fishing efforts have been increasing, the five other regions have been classified as "overfished." This designation implies that the fisheries have been overexploited and that fish stocks have fallen below the level necessary to replenish themselves fully through natural reproduction. Some species, such as the barn door skate, have been inadvertently overfished nearly to extinction as a consequence of bycatch in fisheries targeting cod and redfish.
                        <br><br>
                        Coastal aquaculture provides a significant and growing share of marine food production. Shellfish culturing began as early as the Middle Ages along the Atlantic coast of Europe. Oysters, mussels, and hard and soft clams are produced in protected embayments and estuaries. Atlantic salmon has become an important cultured finfish in Scandinavia, Scotland, the Canadian Maritime Provinces, and Maine, where the species is grown in large-scale fish pens in open-ocean waters. Research and development efforts in Europe, Canada, and the United States have focused on growing species in open-ocean environments, where conflicts with other uses are minimized. Salmon, cod, haddock, fluke, sea scallops, and mussels have been among the species of particular interest.

                        A wealth of petroleum and natural gas lies under the continental shelves and slopes and the oceanic rises and plateaus of the Atlantic basin proper and portions of its marginal seas. The amount of recoverable reserves is enormous: some estimates have ranged as high as one-third of the projected total for all of the world’s recoverable oil and natural gas. The value of these resources represents the vast majority of all of the Atlantic’s nonrenewable resources. In the United States, revenues from offshore leases have been one of the largest sources of federal income, and receipts from offshore production have been important for the economies of the United Kingdom and Norway since the 1970s.

                        The undersea exploration of hydrocarbons has not come without risk to the ocean environment, however. One of the worst petroleum-rated environmental disasters occurred in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico after the explosion and subsequent sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, approximately 41 miles (66 km) off the coast of Louisiana, resulted in the largest marine oil spill in history (see Deepwater Horizon oil spill). The massive spill had a devastating effect on the aquatic wildlife, proving fatal for birds, mammals, and sea turtles. Extensive revisions to offshore-drilling regulations were issued in April 2016 in the hope that they would mitigate the likelihood of future disasters.

                        The earliest exploitation of Atlantic hydrocarbon reserves occurred in Lake Maracaibo (a nearly enclosed embayment in northwestern Venezuela that is connected by a narrow channel to the Caribbean Sea) during World War I, followed in the 1940s by the development of nearshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Extensive offshore seismic exploration since the 1960s has revealed recoverable oil and natural gas deposits elsewhere in the Atlantic. Most of these deposits are found in the sediments of the continental rise and shelf areas, and they are concentrated in four primary provinces: the Gulf of Mexico, mainly along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas and in the Bay of Campeche; the North Sea; the west-central coast of Africa, principally in the Niger River delta region and off the coasts of Gabon and Cabinda (an exclave of Angola north of the Congo River); and east of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Exploration has been conducted in all four of these areas, and production has grown steadily. Great technological advancement has taken place in the immense North Sea fields, and experience there has contributed much toward understanding the operational and environmental challenges of exploiting newer, more-difficult areas of the seabed.

                        Massive coal deposits have been discovered deep beneath the floor of the North Sea and along portions of the continental shelf, but limitations in technology have hindered their exploitation. Some coal is mined off the coasts of Cornwall in Britain and Nova Scotia by means of land-based mine shafts.

                        Methane hydrates are an important potential energy resource found in some Atlantic ocean sediments. Hydrates are a gas (methane) surrounded by water molecules existing in a solid form. Below depths of roughly 1,650 feet (500 metres), methane hydrates can occur as stable deposits in sediments of the ocean floor up to hundreds of feet thick. Research into the extraction and production of methane hydrates as a backstop resource to existing supplies of petroleum and natural gas has been ongoing. In the United States, methane deposits in the permafrost regions of Alaska and surrounding waters and in a large area off the mid-Atlantic coast are among the most highly concentrated.

                        Extensive mining of sand, gravel, and shell deposits in shallow parts of the continental shelf takes place off the coasts of the United States and Britain. The recovered aggregates are used as landfill, for construction, and for making concrete. Deposits of calcareous shells are dredged off the coast of Iceland and on the Great Bahama Bank in the Bahamas, and the shells are used in cement manufacture and as a soil additive. Offshore placer deposits of precious metals, metallic ores (e.g., of iron, tin, titanium, and chromium), and gemstones are found at various points along the Atlantic coastline, particularly off the southeastern United States, Wales, Brazil, Mauritania, and Namibia. Exploitation of these deposits has been erratic. Diamonds have been dredged from the shallow waters and beaches off the coast of Namibia near the mouth of the Orange River. Exploitation has moved more recently into deeper waters offshore. Quantities of phosphorite are found along the continental margin in a number of locations, the largest deposits occurring off the coast of the United States, beyond the mouth of the Río de la Plata off Uruguay and Argentina, between Patagonia and the Falkland Islands, and around the southern tip of South Africa. Sulfur is recovered from the floor of the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana.

                        Indian Ocean, body of salt water covering approximately one-fifth of the total ocean area of the world. It is the smallest, geologically youngest, and physically most complex of the world’s three major oceans (Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian). It stretches for more than 6,200 miles (10,000 km) between the southern tips of Africa and Australia and, without its marginal seas, has an area of about 27,243,000 square miles (70,560,000 square km). The Indian Ocean’s average depth is 12,274 feet (3,741 metres), and its deepest point, in the Sunda Deep of the Java Trench off the southern coast of the island of Java (Indonesia), is 24,442 feet (7,450 metres).
                        <br><br>
                        The Indian Ocean is bounded by Iran, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh to the north; the Malay Peninsula, the Sunda Islands of Indonesia, and Australia to the east; the Southern Ocean to the south; and Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to the west. In the southwest it joins the Atlantic Ocean south of the southern tip of Africa, and to the east and southeast its waters mingle with those of the Pacific Ocean.
                        <br><br>
                        The question of defining the oceanic limits of the Indian Ocean is complicated and remains unsettled. The clearest border and the one most generally agreed upon is that with the Atlantic Ocean, which runs from Cape Agulhas, at the southern tip of Africa, due south along the 20° E meridian. The border with the Pacific Ocean to the southeast is usually drawn from South East Cape on the island of Tasmania south along the 147° E meridian. Bass Strait, between Tasmania and Australia, is considered by some to be part of the Indian Ocean and by others to be part of the Pacific. The northeastern border is the most difficult to define. The one most generally agreed upon runs northwest from Cape Londonderry in Australia across the Timor Sea, along the southern shores of the Lesser Sunda Islands and of Java, and then across the Sunda Strait to the shores of the island of Sumatra. Between Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula the boundary is usually drawn across the Singapore Strait.
                        <br><br>
                        There is no universal agreement on the southern limit of the Indian Ocean. In general (and for the purposes of this article), it is defined as extending southward to latitude 60° S, based on the recognition by several researchers and other authorities of the presence of the Southern Ocean south of this line. Some authorities, however, maintain that the Indian Ocean extends to the Antarctic coast.
                        <br><br>
                        The Indian Ocean has the fewest marginal seas of the major oceans. To the north are the inland Red Sea and Persian Gulf. The Arabian Sea is to the northwest, and the Andaman Sea to the northeast. The large gulfs of Aden and Oman are to the northwest, the Bay of Bengal is to the northeast, and the Great Australian Bight is off the southern coast of Australia.
                        <br><br>
                        The Indian Ocean differs from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in several other respects. In the Northern Hemisphere it is landlocked and does not extend to Arctic waters or have a temperate-to-cold zone. It has fewer islands and narrower continental shelves. It is the only ocean with an asymmetric and, in the north, semiannually reversing surface circulation. It has no separate source of bottom water (i.e., the Indian Ocean’s bottom water originates outside its boundaries) and has two sources of highly saline water (the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea). Below the surface layers, especially in the north, the ocean’s water is extremely low in oxygen.

                    <dd>
                        The origin and evolution of the Indian Ocean is the most complicated of the three major oceans. Its formation is a consequence of the breakup, which began about 180 million years ago, of the southern supercontinent Gondwana (or Gondwanaland); by the movement to the northeast of the Indian subcontinent (beginning about 125 million years ago), which began colliding with Eurasia about 50 million years ago; and by the western movement of Africa and separation of Australia from Antarctica some 53 million years ago. By 36 million years ago the Indian Ocean had taken on its present configuration. Although it first opened some 140 million years ago, almost all of the Indian Ocean basin is less than 80 million years old.

                    <dt><h4>Oceanic ridges and fracture zones
                    </h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The oceanic ridges consist of a rugged, seismically active mountain chain that is part of the worldwide oceanic ridge system and still contains centres of seafloor spreading in several places. The ridges form an inverted Y on the ocean floor, starting in the upper northwest with the Carlsberg Ridge in the Arabian Sea, turning due south past the Chagos-Laccadive Plateau, and becoming the Mid-Indian (or Central Indian) Ridge. Southeast of Madagascar the ridge branches: the Southwest Indian Ridge continues to the southwest until it merges into the Atlantic-Indian Ridge south of Africa, and the Southeast Indian Ridge trends to the east until it joins the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge south of Tasmania. Most striking is the aseismic (virtually earthquake-free) Ninetyeast Ridge, which is the longest and straightest in the world ocean. First discovered in 1962, it runs northward along the 90° E meridian (hence its name) for 2,800 miles (4,500 km) from the zonal Broken Ridge at latitudes 31° S to 9° N and can be traced farther under the sediments of the Bay of Bengal. Other important meridional aseismic ridges include the Chagos-Laccadive, Madagascar, and Mozambique plateaus, which are not part of the global oceanic ridge system.

                        The fracture zones of the Indian Ocean offset the axis of the oceanic ridges mostly in a north-south direction. Prominent are the Owen, Prince Edward, Vema, and Amsterdam fracture zones along the ridges, with the immense Diamantina Fracture Zone found to the southwest of Australia.

                    <dd>
                        Seamounts are extinct submarine volcanoes that are conically shaped and often flat-topped. They rise abruptly from the abyssal plain to heights at least 3,300 feet (1,000 metres) above the ocean floor. In the Indian Ocean, seamounts are particularly abundant between Réunion and Seychelles in the Central Indian Basin and the Vening Meinesz group near Wharton Basin. Bardin, Kohler, Nikitin, and Williams seamounts are examples.

                        Ocean basins are characterized by smooth, flat plains of thick sediment with abyssal hills (i.e., features that are less than 3,300 feet high) at the bottom flanks of the oceanic ridges. The Indian Ocean’s complex ridge topography led to the formation of many basins that range in width from 200 to 5,600 miles (320 to 9,000 km). From roughly north to south they include the Arabian, Somali, Mascarene, Madagascar, Mozambique, Agulhas, and Crozet basins in the west and the Central Indian (the largest), Wharton, and South Australia basins in the east.

                        The continental shelf extends to an average width of about 75 miles (120 km) in the Indian Ocean, with its widest points (190 miles [300 km]) off Mumbai (Bombay) on the western coast of India and off northwestern Australia. The island shelves are only about 1,000 feet (300 metres) wide. The shelf break is at a depth of about 460 feet (140 metres). Submarine canyons indent the steep slope below the break. The Ganges (Ganga) and Indus rivers of Asia and the Zambezi River of Africa have all carved particularly large canyons. Their sediment loads extend far beyond the shelf, form the rises at the foot of the slope, and contribute to the abyssal plains of their respective basins. The Ganges sediment cone is the world’s widest and thickest.

                        The Indian Ocean has the fewest trenches of any of the world’s oceans. The narrow (50 miles [80 km]), volcanic, and seismically active Java Trench is the world’s second longest, stretching more than 2,800 miles (4,500 km) from southwest of Java and continuing northward as the Sunda Trench past Sumatra, with an extension along the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The portion of that system adjacent to Sumatra was the centre of a massive undersea earthquake in 2004 (magnitude 9.1) that affected some 600 miles (1,000 km) of the associated fault zone. A series of devastating tsunamis generated by the quake swamped coastal towns, particularly in Indonesia, and reached to the northern end of the Bay of Bengal and as far as the Indian Ocean’s western shores.

                    <dd>
                        The immense load of suspended sediments from the rivers emptying into the Indian Ocean is the highest of the three major oceans, and nearly half of it comes from the Indian subcontinent alone. Those terrigenous sediments occur mostly on the continental shelves, slopes, and rises, and they merge into abyssal plains. Cones of thicknesses of at least 1 mile (1.6 km) are found in the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and the Somali and Mozambique basins. Wharton Basin off northern Australia has the oldest sediments. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra cone, sediments exceed 7 miles (11 km) in thickness and extend to latitude 10° S. Little sediment has accumulated along the southern Sunda Islands, probably because the Java Trench acts as a sediment trap; instead, silicic volcanic ash is found there. Brown and red clay sediments dominate in the deep sea between 10° N and 40° S away from islands and continents and are 1,000 feet (300 metres) thick. In the equatorial zone, an area of high oceanic productivity, calcareous and siliceous oozes are abundant. South of and beneath the Antarctic Convergence (roughly 50° S), another highly productive area, are diatomaceous algal oozes. Sediments are absent over a width of about 45 miles (70 km) on the oceanic ridge crests, and the flanks are only sparsely covered. The ocean floor is composed of basalt in various stages of alteration. The principal authigenic (ocean-formed) mineral deposits are phosphorites at depths of 130 to 1,300 feet (40 to 400 metres), ferromanganese crusts at depths of 3,300 to 8,200 feet (1,000 to 2,500 metres), ferromanganese nodules at depths greater than 10,000 feet (3,000 metres), and hydrothermal metalliferous sediments at the crests of the Carlsberg and Central Indian ridges.

                        The greater part of the water area of the Indian Ocean lies within the tropical and temperate zones. The shallow waters of the tropical zone are characterized by numerous corals and other organisms capable of building—together with calcareous red algae—reefs and coral islands. Those coralline structures shelter a thriving marine fauna consisting of sponges, worms, crabs, mollusks, sea urchins, brittle stars, starfish, and small but exceedingly brightly coloured reef fish.

                        The upwellings that occur in several coastal regions of the Indian Ocean—particularly in the northern Arabian Sea and along the South African coast—cause nutrients to concentrate in surface waters. <img src="/MiniProjects/BackgroundPhotos/indianfishery.jfif" alt="fishery" class="full">That phenomenon, in turn, produces immense quantities of phytoplankton that are the basis for large populations of commercially valuable marine animals. Despite great fishery potentials, however, most commercial fishing is done by small-scale fishermen at lower depths, while deep-sea resources (with the exception of tuna) remain poorly fished.
                        <br><br>
                        The principal coastal species—shrimp, croakers, snappers, skates, and grunts—are caught by littoral countries, while pelagic fish of higher value—including species of tuna and tunalike species such as billfish that are found in tropical and subtropical waters—are taken mostly by the world’s major fishing countries (e.g., Japan, South Korea, and Russia). Shrimp is the most important commercial species for coastal countries, with India accounting for the largest catch. Lesser quantities of sardines, mackerel, and anchovies also are exploited by littoral states. Since coastal nations now can claim sovereignty over resources within an exclusive economic zone that extends 200 nautical miles (230 statute miles, or 370 km) from their coasts, it has become possible for small countries such as Maldives to increase national income by selling fishing rights in their zones to the major fishing countries that have the capital and technology to exploit pelagic resources.

                    <dd> 
                        By far the most valuable mineral resource is petroleum, and the Persian Gulf is the largest oil-producing region in the world. Exploration for offshore petroleum and natural gas also has been under way in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, both of which are believed to have large reserves. Other sites of exploration activity are off the northwestern coast of Australia, in the Andaman Sea, off the coast of Africa south of the Equator, and off the southwestern coast of Madagascar. Other than the countries of the Persian Gulf, only India produces commercial quantities of oil from offshore areas, with a large proportion of its total production coming from fields off the coast of Mumbai. Some natural gas also is produced from fields off the northwestern coast of Australia.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Another potentially valuable mineral resource is contained in manganese nodules, which abound in the Indian Ocean. Sampling sites throughout the central part of the ocean, as far south as South Africa, and east in the South Australian Basin have yielded nodules; the manganese content has been highest in the east and lowest toward the northwest. The difficulty in mining and processing those minerals, despite advances in technology, has precluded their commercial extraction. Other minerals of potential commercial value are ilmenite (a mixture of iron and titanium oxide), tin, monazite (a rare earth), zircon, and chromite, all of which are found in nearshore sand bodies.

                        Arctic Ocean, smallest of the world’s oceans, centring approximately on the North Pole. The Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas—the Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, Kara, Barents, White, Greenland, and Beaufort and, according to some oceanographers, also the Bering and Norwegian—are the least-known basins and bodies of water in the world ocean as a result of their remoteness, hostile weather, and perennial or seasonal ice cover. This is changing, however, because the Arctic may exhibit a strong response to global change and may be capable of initiating dramatic climatic changes through alterations induced in the oceanic thermohaline circulation by its cold, southward-moving currents or through its effects on the global albedo resulting from changes in its total ice cover.
                        <br><br>
                        Although the Arctic Ocean is by far the smallest of Earth’s oceans, having only a little more than one-sixth the area of the next largest, the Indian Ocean, its area of 5,440,000 square miles (14,090,000 square km) is five times larger than that of the largest sea, the Mediterranean. The deepest sounding obtained in Arctic waters is 18,050 feet (5,502 metres), but the average depth is only 3,240 feet (987 metres).
                        <br><br>
                        Distinguished by several unique features, including a cover of perennial ice and almost complete encirclement by the landmasses of North America, Eurasia, and Greenland, the north polar region has been a subject of speculation since the earliest concepts of a spherical Earth. From astronomical observations, the Greeks theorized that north of the Arctic Circle there must be a midnight sun at midsummer and continual darkness at midwinter. The enlightened view was that both the northern and southern polar regions were uninhabitable frozen wastes, whereas the more popular belief was that there was a halcyon land beyond the north wind where the sun always shone and people called Hyperboreans led a peaceful life. Such speculations provided incentives for adventurous men to risk the hazards of severe climate and fear of the unknown to further geographic knowledge and national and personal prosperity.

                    <dd>  
                        The tectonic history of the Arctic Basin in the Cenozoic Era (i.e., about the past 65 million years) is largely known from available geophysical data. It is clear from aeromagnetic and seismic data that the Eurasia Basin was formed by seafloor spreading along the axis of the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge. The focus of spreading began under the edge of the Asian continent, from which a narrow splinter of its northern continental margin was separated and translated northward to form the present Lomonosov Ridge. The origin of the Amerasia Basin is far less clear. Most researchers favour a hypothesis of opening by rotation of the Arctic-Alaska lithospheric plate away from the North American Plate during the Cretaceous Period (about 145 to 65 million years ago). Better understanding of the origin of the Arctic Ocean’s basins and ridges is critical for reconstructing the paleoclimatic evolution of the ocean and for understanding its relevance to global environmental changes.

                        The sediments of the Arctic Ocean floor record the natural of the physical environment, climate, and ecosystems on time scales determined by the ability to sample them through coring and at resolutions determined by the rates of deposition. Of the hundreds of sediment corings taken, only four penetrate deeply enough to predate the onset of cold climatic conditions. The oldest (approximately 80-million-year-old black muds and 67-million-year-old siliceous oozes) document that at least part of the Arctic Ocean was relatively warm and biologically productive prior to 40 million years ago. Unfortunately, none of the available seafloor cores have sampled sediments from the time interval between 35 to 3 million years ago. Thus there is no direct evidence of the onset of cooling that produced the present perennial ice cover. All the other cores collected contain younger sediments that were deposited in an ocean dominated by ice cover. They contain evidence of terrigenous (land-derived) sediments formed by bordering glaciers and transported by sea ice.

                        From the late 19th century, when the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen first discovered an ocean in the central Arctic, until the middle of the 20th century, it was believed that the Arctic Ocean was a single large basin. Explorations after 1950 revealed the true complex nature of the ocean floor. Rather than being a single basin, the Arctic Ocean consists of two principal deep basins that are subdivided into four smaller basins by three transoceanic submarine ridges. The central of these ridges extends from the continental shelf off Ellesmere Island to the New Siberian Islands, a distance of 1,100 miles (1,770 km). This enormous submarine mountain range was discovered by Soviet scientists in 1948–49 and reported in 1954. It is named the Lomonosov Ridge after the scientist, poet, and grammarian Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov.
                        <br><br>
                        The Lomonosov Ridge has an average relief of about 10,000 feet and divides the Arctic Ocean into two physiographically complex basins. These are referred to as the Eurasia Basin on the European side of the ridge and the Amerasia Basin on the American side. The Lomonosov Ridge varies in width from 40 to 120 miles, and its crest ranges in depth between 3,100 and 5,400 feet.
                        <br><br>
                        The Eurasia Basin is divided into two smaller basins by a trans-Arctic Ocean extension of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This Arctic segment of the global ridge system is called the Nansen Cordillera, which was named for Fridtjof Nansen after its discovery in the early 1960s. It is a locus of active ocean-floor spreading, with a well-developed rift valley and flanking rift mountains. The Fram Basin lies between the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge and the Lomonosov Ridge at a depth of 14,070 feet. The geographic north pole is located over the floor of the Fram Basin near its juncture with the Lomonosov Ridge. The smallest of the Arctic Ocean subbasins, called the Nansen Basin, lies between the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge and the Eurasian continental margin and has a floor depth of 13,800 feet.
                        <br><br>
                        The Amerasia Basin is divided into two unequal basins by the Alpha Cordillera (Alpha Ridge), a broad, rugged submarine mountain chain that extends to within 4,600 feet of the ocean surface. The origin of this seismically inactive ridge, which was discovered in the late 1950s, is undetermined and holds the key to understanding the origin of the Amerasia Basin. The Makarov Basin lies between the Alpha Cordillera and the Lomonosov Ridge, and its floor is at a depth of 13,200 feet. The largest subbasin of the Arctic Ocean is the Canada Basin, which extends approximately 700 miles from the Beaufort Shelf to the Alpha Cordillera. The smooth basin floor slopes gently from east to west, where it is interrupted by regions of sea knolls. The average depth of the Canada Basin is 12,500 feet.
                        <br><br>
                        The Arctic Ocean is unique in that nearly one-third of its total area is underlain by continental shelf, which is asymmetrically distributed around its circumference. North of Alaska and Greenland the shelf is 60 to 120 miles wide, which is the normal width of continental shelves. In contrast, the Siberian and Chukchi shelves off Eurasia range from 300 to 1,100 miles in width. The edge of the continental margin is dissected by numerous submarine valleys. The largest of these, the Svyataya Anna Trough, is 110 miles wide and 300 miles long.

                        Several factors in the Arctic Ocean make its physical, chemical, and biological processes significantly different from those in the adjoining North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Most notable is the covering ice pack, which reduces the exchange of energy between ocean and atmosphere by about 100 times. In addition, sea ice greatly reduces the penetration of sunlight needed for the photosynthetic processes of marine life and impedes the mixing effect of the winds. A further significant distinguishing feature is the high ratio of freely connected shallow seas to deep basins. Whereas the continental shelf on the North American side of the Arctic Ocean is of a normal width (approximately 40 miles), the Eurasian sector is hundreds of miles broad, with peninsulas and islands dividing it into five main marginal seas: the Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, Kara, and Barents. These marginal seas occupy 36 percent of the area of the Arctic Ocean, yet they contain only 2 percent of its water volume. With the exception of the Mackenzie River of Canada and the Colville River of Alaska, all major rivers discharge into these marginal shallow seas. The combination of large marginal seas, with a high ratio of exposed surface to total volume, plus large summer inputs of fresh water, greatly influences surface-water conditions in the Arctic Ocean.

                        Low-salinity waters enter the Arctic Ocean from the Pacific through the shallow Bering Strait. Although the mean inflow seems to be driven by a slight difference in sea level between the North Pacific and Arctic oceans, a large source of variability is induced by the wind field, primarily large-scale atmospheric circulation over the North Pacific. The amount of fresh water entering the Arctic Ocean is about 2 percent of the total input. Precipitation is believed to be about 10 times greater than loss by evaporation, although both figures can be only roughly estimated. Through all these various routes and mechanisms, the exchange rate of the Arctic Ocean is estimated to be approximately 210 million cubic feet (5.9 million cubic metres) per second.
                        <br><br>
                        All waters of the Arctic Ocean are cold. Variations in density are thus mainly determined by changes in salinity. Arctic waters have a two-layer system: a thin and less dense surface layer is separated by a strong density gradient, referred to as a pycnocline, from the main body of water, which is of quite uniform density. This pycnocline restricts convective motion and the vertical transfer of heat and salt, and hence the surface layer acts as a cap over the larger masses of warmer water below.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite this overall similarity in gross oceanographic structure, the waters of the Arctic Ocean can be classified into three major masses and one lesser mass.
                        <br><br>
                        1. The water extending from the surface to a depth of about 650 feet (about 200 metres) is the most variable and heterogeneous of all that in the Arctic. This is because of the latent heat of freezing and thawing; brine addition from the process of ice freezing; freshwater addition by rivers, ice melting, and precipitation; and great variations in insolation (rate of delivery of solar energy) and energy flux as a result of sea ice cover. Water temperature may vary over a range of 7 °F (4 °C) and salinity from 28 to 34 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (28 to 34 parts per thousand [ 0/00]).
                        <br><br>
                        2. Warmer Atlantic water everywhere underlies Arctic surface water from a depth of about 650 to 3,000 feet. As it cools it becomes so dense that it slips below the surface layer on entering the Arctic Basin. The temperature of this water is about 34 to 37 °F (1 to 3 °C) as it enters the basin, but it is gradually cooled so that by the time it spreads to the Beaufort Sea it has a maximum temperature of 32.9 to 33.1 °F (0.5 to 0.6 °C). The salinity of the Atlantic layer varies between 34.5 and 35 0/00.
                        <br><br>
                        3. Bottom water extends beneath the Atlantic layer to the ocean floor. This is colder than the Atlantic water (below 32 °F, or 0 °C) but has the same salinity.
                        <br><br>
                        4. An inflow of Pacific water can be observed in the Amerasia Basin but not in the Eurasia Basin. This warmer and fresher water mixes with colder and more saline water in the Chukchi Sea, where its density enables it to flow as a wedge between the Arctic and Atlantic waters. The Pacific water, by the time it reaches the Canada Basin, has a temperature range of 31.1 to 30.8 °F (−0.5 to −0.7 °C) and salinities between 31.5 and 33 0/00.
                        <br><br>
                        Arctic waters are driven by the wind and by density differences. The net effect of tides is unknown but could have some modifying effect on gross circulation. The motion of surface waters is best known from observations of ice drift. The most striking feature of the surface circulation pattern is the large clockwise gyre (circular motion) that covers almost the entire Amerasia Basin. Fletcher’s Ice Island (T-3) made two orbits in this gyre over a 20-year period, which is some indication of the current speed. The northern extremity of the gyre bifurcates and jets out of the Greenland-Spitsbergen passage as the East Greenland Current, attaining speeds of 6 to 16 inches per second. Circulation of the shallow Eurasian shelf seas seems to be a complex series of counterclockwise gyres, complicated by islands and other topographic relief.
                        <br><br>
                        Circulation of the deeper Atlantic water is less well known. On entering the Eurasia Basin, the plunging Greenland Sea water appears to flow eastward along the edge of the continental margin until it fans out and enters the Amerasia Basin along a broad front over the crest of the Lomonosov Ridge. There seems to be a general counterclockwise circulation in the Eurasia Basin and a smaller clockwise gyre in the Beaufort Sea. Speeds are slow—probably less than two inches per second.
                        <br><br>
                        The circulation of the bottom water is unknown but can be inferred to be similar to the Atlantic layer. Measured values of dissolved oxygen show that the bottom water is well ventilated, dissolved oxygen everywhere exceeding 70 percent of saturation.

                        The cover of sea ice suppresses wind stress and wind mixing, reflects a large proportion of incoming solar radiation, imposes an upper limit on the surface temperature, and impedes evaporation. Wind and water stresses keep the ice pack in almost continuous motion, causing the formation of cracks (leads), open ponds (polynya), and pressure ridges. Along these ridges the pack ice may be locally stacked high and project downward 33–80 feet (about 10–25 metres) into the ocean. Besides its deterrence to the exchange of energy between the ocean and the atmosphere, the formation of sea ice generates vast quantities of cold water that help drive the circulation of the world ocean system.
                        <br><br>
                        Sea ice rarely forms in the open ocean below a latitude of 60° N but does occur in more southerly enclosed bays, rivers, and seas. Between about 60° and 75° N the occurrence of sea ice is seasonal, and there is usually a period of the year when the water is ice-free. Above a latitude of 75° N there is a more or less permanent ice cover. Even there, however, as much as 10 percent of the area consists of open water owing to the continual opening of leads and polynyas.
                        <br><br>
                        In the process of freezing, the salt in seawater is expelled as brine. The degree to which this rejection takes place increases as the rate of freezing decreases. Typically, newly formed sea ice has a salinity of 4 to 6 0/00. Even after freezing the process of purification continues but at a much slower rate. By the time the ice is one year old, it is sufficiently salt-free to be melted for drinking. This year-old, or older, salt-free sea ice is referred to as multiyear sea ice or polar pack. It can be distinguished by its smoother, rounded surface and pale blue colour. Younger ice is more jagged and grayer in colour. Because the hardness and strength of ice increases as the salts are expelled, polar pack is a special threat to shipping. First-year ice has a characteristic thickness of up to 6 feet (2 metres), whereas multiyear ice averages about 12 feet (about 4 metres) in thickness.
                        <br><br>
                        There is no direct evidence as to the onset of the Arctic Ocean ice cover. The origin of the ice pack was influenced by a number of factors, such as the formation of terrestrial ice caps and the interaction of the Arctic and North Atlantic waters—with their different temperature and salinity structures—with atmospheric climate variables. What can be inferred from available data is that there was not a continuous ice cover throughout the Pleistocene Epoch (i.e., about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago). Rather, there was a continually warm ocean until approximately 2,000,000 years ago, followed by a permanent ice pack about 850,000 years ago.
                        <br><br>
                        Sea ice cover has fluctuated throughout the Holocene Epoch (11,700 years ago to the present) in response to changes in sea levels and the increases in coastline elevation following the retreat of the Pleistocene ice sheets (see isostasy). These fluctuations were largely centred in the eastern Arctic Ocean during multiyear warm episodes, where ice cover would advance and retreat with the seasons. In the late 20th century, however, Arctic sea ice coverage declined persistently (about 3 percent per decade since 1978) in response to the effects of global warming, which lifts regional near-surface air temperatures above freezing for long portions of the year.

                        Southern Ocean, also called Antarctic Ocean, body of salt water covering approximately one-sixteenth of Earth’s total ocean area. The Southern Ocean is made up of the portions of the world ocean south of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans and their tributary seas surrounding Antarctica below 60° S. It is unbroken by any other continental landmass. Its narrowest constriction is the Drake Passage, 600 miles (about 1,000 km) wide, between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. In terms of area, only the Arctic Ocean is smaller.

                        The Southern Ocean covers 8,479,000 square miles (21,960,000 square km), and it holds 17,226,000 cubic miles (71,800,000 cubic km) of water. It has an average depth of 10,728 feet (3,270 metres) and a maximum depth of 24,383 feet (7,432 metres) in the South Sandwich Trench, southeast of the island of South Georgia.
                        <br><br>
                        The structure of the ocean floor includes a continental shelf usually less than 160 miles (about 260 km) wide that attains its maximum width of more than 1,600 miles (2,600 km) in the vicinity of the Weddell and Ross seas. There are oceanic basins farther north that are as much as 14,800 feet (4,500 metres) deep, defined by oceanic rises and often marked by ranges of abyssal hills. There are also narrow oceanic trenches with high relief, such as the South Sandwich Trench on the eastern side of the South Sandwich Islands. Other relief features include oceanic plateaus that rise from the oceanic basins to depths of less than 6,650 feet (2,000 metres) below sea level and form rather flat regions, which are often covered by relatively thick sedimentary deposits.

                        The flow of currents in the Southern Ocean is complex. Water cooled by cold air, outgoing radiation, and katabatic winds off of the Antarctic continent sinks and flows northward along the ocean bottom and is replaced at the surface by an equal volume of warmer water flowing south from the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans. The meeting point of the two is the Antarctic Convergence, where conditions favour the development of phytoplankton, consisting of diatoms and other single-celled plants. The ocean’s most important organism in the higher food chain is the small shrimplike krill. Animals on the sea bottom of the nearshore zone include the sessile hydrozoans, corals, sponges, and bryozoans, as well as the foraging crablike sea spiders and isopods, the annelid worm polychaete, echinoids, starfish, and a variety of crustaceans and mollusks. At the sea bottom there are also eelpouts, sea snails, rat-tailed fishes, and codlike fishes. Rare non-bony types of fish include hagfish and skates. Many species of deep-sea fish are known south of the Antarctic Convergence, but only three, a barracuda and two lantern fishes, seem to be confined to this zone.

                        Invertebrate life of Antarctica includes species of microscopic mites such as Alaskozetes antarcticus, lice, nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, krill and springtails. The few terrestrial vertebrates are limited to the sub-Antarctic islands.[141] The flightless midge Belgica antarctica, the largest purely terrestrial animal in Antarctica, reaches 6 mm (1⁄4 in) in size.[142]

                        Antarctic krill, which congregate in large schools, is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, being an important food organism for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, squid, icefish, and many bird species, such as penguins and albatrosses.[143] Some species of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals.[144]

                        The emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica; it and the Adélie penguin breed farther south than any other penguin.[144] The snow petrel is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica.[145]

                        The Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom.[146] The Weddell seal, a "true seal", is named after Sir James Weddell, commander of British sealing expeditions in the Weddell Sea.[147] Leopard seals are apex predators in the Antarctic ecosystem, and migrate across the Southern Ocean in search of food.[148]

                        A Census of Marine Life by some 500 researchers during the International Polar Year, was released in 2010. The research found that more than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of 12,000 km (7,456 mi). Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. Smaller forms of life such as sea cucumbers and free-swimming snails also found in both polar oceans. Factors that may aid in their distribution include temperature differences between the deep ocean at the poles and the equator of no more than 5 °C (9.0 °F) and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which are able to transport eggs and larva.[149]

                        About 1,150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming.[150][151] Some of these species, having evolved under extreme conditions, have colonized structural cavities within porous rocks and have contributed to shaping the rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges.[152]

                        The simplified morphology of such fungi, along with their similar biological structures, metabolism systems capable of remaining active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles, make them well suited to such environments. Their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to UV.[152]

                        Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that life on Mars might have been similar to Antarctic fungi, such as Cryomyces antarcticus and Cryomyces minteri.[152][153] Some of these species of fungi, which are apparently endemic to Antarctica, live in bird dung, and have evolved so they can grow inside extremely cold dung, but also pass through the intestines of warm-blooded animals.

                        About 300 million years ago, Permian forests started to cover the continent, and tundra vegetation survived as late as 15 million years ago,[156] but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor soil quality, and a lack of moisture and sunlight inhibit plant growth, causing low species diversity and limited distribution. The flora largely consists of bryophytes (25 species of liverworts and 100 species of mosses). There are three species of flowering plants, all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula: Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic hair grass), Colobanthus quitensis (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native Poa annua (annual bluegrass).[157] Plant growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.

                        Of the 700 species of algae in Antarctica, most are phytoplankton. Multicoloured snow algae and diatoms are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer. Bacteria have been found as deep as 800 m (0.50 mi; 2,600 ft) under the ice.[158] It is thought likely that there exists a native bacterial community within the subterranean water body of Lake Vostok.[159] The existence of life there is thought to strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on Jupiter's moon Europa, which may have water beneath its water-ice crust.[160] There exists a community of extremophile bacteria in the highly alkaline waters of Lake Untersee.[161][162] The prevalence of highly resilient creatures in such inhospitable areas could further bolster the argument for extraterrestrial life in cold, methane-rich environments
