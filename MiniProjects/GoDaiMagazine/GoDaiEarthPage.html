                        Asia, the world’s largest and most diverse continent. It occupies the eastern four-fifths of the giant Eurasian landmass. Asia is more a geographic term than a homogeneous continent, and the use of the term to describe such a vast area always carries the potential of obscuring the enormous diversity among the regions it encompasses. Asia has both the highest and the lowest points on the surface of Earth, has the longest coastline of any continent, is subject overall to the world’s widest climatic extremes, and, consequently, produces the most varied forms of vegetation and animal life on Earth. In addition, the peoples of Asia have established the broadest variety of human adaptation found on any of the continents.

                        Asia is bounded by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Indian Ocean to the south, the Red Sea (as well as the inland seas of the Atlantic Ocean—the Mediterranean and the Black) to the southwest, and Europe to the west. Asia is separated from North America to the northeast by the Bering Strait and from Australia to the southeast by the seas and straits connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans. The Isthmus of Suez unites Asia with Africa, and it is generally agreed that the Suez Canal forms the border between them. Two narrow straits, the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, separate Anatolia from the Balkan Peninsula.

                        The distribution pattern of precipitation throughout the year is varied. Relatively uniform moisture is characteristic of the Asian equatorial zone. Maximum summer precipitation and minimum winter precipitation are the rule in the subequatorial zones and in other regions with monsoon climates, as well as in those areas where there is summer movement of the fronts—the polar front in the mountains of southern Siberia and the Arctic front in the subarctic regions. Wet winters and dry summers are typical of the Mediterranean climatic region in West Asia, where precipitation is associated with the winter activity of the polar front. That polar-front activity, accompanied by maximum precipitation, occurs in the spring in the interior parts of the West Asian highlands. Summer and winter precipitation merges in some parts of Asia. In the Kolkhida area of Georgia east of the Black Sea, the summer rains—brought by the northwesterly Atlantic air currents—merge with the cyclonic Mediterranean winter rains. In some areas of Japan, Korea, and eastern China, there is uniform precipitation when, in addition to the summer monsoon, the winter monsoon brings moisture.<img src="/MiniProjects/ChiPage/chinamonsoon.jpg" alt="chinamonsoon" class="right"><br/>
                        

                        As the aggregate result of those various meteorological patterns, the following types of climate may be distinguished in Asia: the tundra climate (associated with the cold, treeless plains of the Arctic lowlands of Asia); the cold, sharply continental climate of eastern Siberia; the cold, moderately humid western Siberian climate; the humid, subtropical climate associated with the Kolkhida region; the desert climate of the temperate zone; the Mediterranean subtropical climate of the western edge of West Asia; the subtropical desert climate; the mountain-steppe highland subtropical climate of West and Central Asia; the alpine desert climate; the climate of the eastern Pamirs, the Karakoram Range, and the Plateau of Tibet;  the climate of the tropical deserts; the temperate monsoon climate of the East Asian part of Siberia and the northern parts of Japan and eastern China; the subtropical monsoon climate of southern Japan and of southeastern China; the subequatorial monsoon climate of South Asia, eastern Java, and the Lesser Sunda Islands; and the equatorial climate of the Greater Sunda Islands. All the various features of the types of climate mentioned exert a strong influence on other natural conditions, as well as on the landscape as a whole. <img src="/MiniProjects/ChiPage/bangladesh.jpg" alt="bangladesh" class="full">

                    <dd>
                        It is common practice in geographic literature to divide Asia into large regions, each grouping together a number of countries. Those physiographic divisions usually consist of North Asia, including the bulk of Siberia and the northeastern edges of the continent; East Asia, including the continental part of the Russian Far East region of Siberia, the East Asian islands, Korea, and eastern and northeastern China; Central Asia, including the Plateau of Tibet, the Junggar and Tarim basins, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, the Gobi, and the Sino-Tibetan ranges; Middle Asia, including the Turan Plain, the Pamirs, the Gissar and Alay ranges, and the Tien Shan; South Asia, including the Philippine and Malay archipelagoes, peninsular Southeast Asia and peninsular India, the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and the Himalayas; and West (or Southwest) Asia, including the West Asian highlands (Anatolia, Armenia, and Iran), the Levant, and the Arabian Peninsula. Sometimes the Philippines, the Malay Archipelago, and peninsular Southeast Asia, instead of being considered part of South Asia, are grouped separately as Southeast Asia. Yet another variation of the basic categories is commonly made to divide Asia into its cultural regions.

                        An immense range of vegetation is found in Asia, the result of the continent’s wide diversity of latitude, elevation, and climate. Natural conditions, however, are not entirely responsible for the associations of trees, plants, and grasses of Asia; natural landscapes have been transformed by more than eight millennia of farming and other human activities.
                    </dd><br/>

                    <h2>The geographic pattern of vegetation</h2><br/>
                    <dt><h3>North and Central Asia</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The natural landscape has been least affected by people in sparsely populated North Asia. Vast plains, continentality, and the nearness of the Arctic Ocean explain the presence there of a zone of tundra—cold-tolerant low-lying vegetation in an area of permafrost (permanently frozen subsoil)—similar to that found in the European part of Russia and in Canada and the U.S. state of Alaska. In more flourishing parts, the tundra has a discontinuous covering of lichens, mosses, sedges, rushes, some grasses, cushions of bilberries, and dwarf trees of willow and birch; in the far north, lichens grow on favourable hillsides. Because of the greater number of hours of daylight during the summer months, when the Arctic Circle region receives the same amount of light energy as the tropics, the tundra in that season is covered with bright flowers. Nevertheless, climate conditions are extreme. In the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago, off the Arctic coast, thawing begins in May and frosts begin in August, although in some years frosts may occur at night throughout the short summer. The soil never thaws below a depth of 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm); consequently, hollows are badly drained and turn into peat bogs. Windy conditions speed evaporation, and the frozen soil cannot absorb water to compensate for that action, so surface drought often results in wind erosion and the removal of sediments deposited by annual riverine floods. 
                        
                        The tundra belt extends still farther south on higher ground. In the Arctic, tundra in the Ural Mountains begins at about 3,000 feet (900 metres), but at latitude 53° N it begins at 4,250 feet (1,300 metres). Tundra extends over large areas of the Chersky, Verkhoyansk, and Kamchatka mountain ranges.

                    <dt><h3>East Asia</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The monsoonal climate in East Asia brings hot and rainy summers, giving rise to a great variety of temperate and tropical vegetation. China has the most varied vegetation of any country in the world, with about 30,000 species, excluding mushrooms and mosses. The enormous variety of plants, which includes a large number of relict forest species, is explained by the negligible impact that Pleistocene glaciations had on the region’s climate. 

                        About two-thirds of Japan’s total area is forested, whereas much of China is deforested (roughly one-seventh of China is under forest cover); sizable tracts remain untouched, however, in the remote rugged regions of China, and many small areas have been reforested. One reason for that difference between the two countries is the traditional respect the Japanese have had for their scenery and, consequently, the strict forestry regulations that have been promulgated and enforced. In addition, the rugged topography and inaccessibility of many of Japan’s forested areas have limited the possibilities for economic exploitation. The best examples of East Asian forest, therefore, are found in Japan, such as in the Kii Peninsula of Honshu.

                        North of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang), much of China was once covered by primeval deciduous forest, most of which has been removed to create farmland. South of the Yangtze, the “true” Chinese forest was prevalent before 1800. A wild growth of trees and shrubs survives, however, throughout the cultivated areas, and parklike tree growth and stands of bamboo are widespread. The original forest cover included 60 different genera of tall trees; among the temperate genera were oak, maple, linden, chestnut, hornbeam, and a species of hickory, and among the tropical genera were magnolia, the tulip tree, the camphor tree, the Spanish cedar, sweet gum, catalpa, and lianas (vines). A variety of conifers of both hemispheres also occurred there, and in the mountains of eastern Sichuan there grew a rare and ancient Chinese conifer, the dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides). Palm trees are found throughout South China and southern South Korea, as well as in the southern parts of Japan; many varieties of bamboo also are found in those regions. China has been proceeding energetically with a program of reforestation. The new forests, however, consisting largely of pines, do not resemble the primeval forests.

                    <dt><h3>South and Southeast Asia</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The wettest parts of peninsular India (such as the Western Ghats) and of Southeast Asia have magnificent tropical forests noteworthy for the variety of their plant life. A significant feature of South Asian vegetation is the family Dipterocarpaceae (yielding aromatic oils and resins), which is represented there by more than 500 species. In parts of peninsular India and Southeast Asia that have a seasonal monsoon climate (with four to eight dry months per year), moist- and dry-deciduous forests thrive. Many of the tree species, such as teak, sal, and sandalwood, are highly valuable and are heavily exploited. In areas with a prolonged dry season and less precipitation (e.g., northwestern India, the interior of the Deccan plateau, and the “dry zone” of Myanmar [Burma]), savanna woodland and thorny thickets of acacias and euphorbias are the predominant natural vegetation. In all of the major climate zones of South and Southeast Asia, and particularly on the alluvial plains, much of the natural vegetation has been cleared to make way for agriculture.

                        Mangrove swamps thrive in the sheltered muddy coasts and deltas. Their outermost edges are represented by species of Rhizophora (red mangrove), followed by those of Bruguiera and Avicennia (white mangrove). The bogs on the landward edges of those swamps abound with the semiaquatic nipa palm.

                        Primeval evergreen rainforest remains in a few parts of South and Southeast Asia. Secondary forest covers a much larger area. The once universally dense forest has given way to parklike forest and wooded savanna as a result of intensive grazing, tree harvesting, and shifting (slash-and-burn) agricultural practices. Extensive fires in such areas have produced a herbaceous landscape, as in the cogonales (areas of coarse tall grasses, used for thatching) of the Philippines.

                        Hevea brasiliensis, the rubber tree introduced into tropical Asia from South America in the 1870s, is particularly important in plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia.

                        In the higher mountains of Southeast Asia, the cooler humid-tropical climate gives rise to deciduous and coniferous temperate forest at elevations of between about 4,250 and 10,000 feet (1,300 and 3,000 metres). Above that level low forests of plants, mostly shrubs of the heath family, are often found. Diverse types of trees grow in the mountain forests of the region. The Rakhine (Arakan) Mountains of Myanmar, for example, are covered with a thick mantle of little bamboos. In the eastern Himalayas sal is intermingled with Castanopsis (a small genus of nut-bearing trees) and pines. Above those are found forests of shrubs and trees of the laurel family and, higher still, oaks and conifers; between about 10,000 and 13,000 feet (3,000 and 4,000 metres), forests of firs occur. The central Himalayas present strikingly beautiful landscapes in the following upward succession: dry sal forest; pine forest; cedars, spruces, pines, and oaks; firs, birches, and tall rhododendrons; rhododendron bushes and junipers above 13,000 feet (4,000 metres); and perpetual snows above 16,000 feet (4,900 metres).

                    <dt><h3>West Asia</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        In West Asia naturally wild vegetation no longer occurs in clearly defined zones but is dispersed in small areas. The region is predominantly arid; desertlike depressions such as the Kyzylkum Desert of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the Karakum Desert of Turkmenistan, and the Rubʿ al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of the Arabian Peninsula contrast with the moist, forested mountains that lie between them. Three climatic zones, however, characterize West Asia: a continental climate in the northern regions; a dry zone, except where northerly winds bring moisture to the mountains, to the south; and a Mediterranean climate along the western edges.

                        A few examples of the variety of vegetation associated with those climatic zones may be cited. In the Karakum Desert grows a strange xerophytic tree, the saxaul, which is oddly shaped, gnarled, and leafless; it is widely used for firewood, and its young sprouts make excellent fodder for camels. Between the galleries of saxauls the desert is interspersed at wide intervals with bushes and tufts of grass. A fringe of steppe covers the area between the Fertile Crescent (which sweeps in an arc from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean) and the north and west of the Syrian Desert. With more than 2,000 species of plants—more than in the whole of the Sahara—the borders of the Syrian Desert are noteworthy for their floral variety. The moist northern slopes of the Pontic Mountains in northern Turkey are covered by magnificent forests of beeches and conifers, with an undergrowth of tall cherry laurels, hollies, and creepers. That type of forest is also found in Georgia and on the northern slopes of the Elburz Mountains in Iran. Along the Mediterranean border of Asia, the natural vegetation is similar to that in other parts of the Mediterranean region: holm oak (an evergreen oak), Aleppo pine (used in shipbuilding), cistus, mastic tree (which yields mastic, an aromatic resin), and other species are found in landscapes of thick underbrush and open scrubland. Extensive forests, with such species as the cedar of Lebanon, once grew in that region, but logging and heavy grazing by livestock have reduced many once-forested areas to grassland and scrubland.

                        The Himalayas, stretching from east to west, form a barrier that largely prevents the movement of fauna southward or northward. Thus, Asia north of the Himalayas, with parts of western Asia and most of East Asia, belongs to the Palearctic (Old World) subregion of the Holarctic zoogeographic region (roughly, the Northern Hemisphere north of the tropics). Asia south of the Himalayas is called the Oriental, or Indian, region. The boundary dividing those zones east and west of the Himalayas is not well marked, however, as the mountain chains there often have a north-south trend facilitating migration of animals between them.

                        Asian faunal habitats have been subjected to the same disruption from human activities that has affected the continent’s vegetation, particularly in regions of extremely dense population (e.g., the great Indian river valleys and the plains and lowlands of eastern and southern China). Asia’s vastness and its numerous remote regions, however, have made it possible for many animal species to live practically undisturbed by human activity. Nonetheless, the threat of extinction remains for many species, most notably for the giant panda of China and the Sumatran rhinoceros and orangutan of Southeast Asia.

                    <h2>The Palearctic region</h2><br/>
                    <p>
                        A distinction can be made between the animal life of the tundra in the north and that of the adjacent taiga farther south. The taiga in turn merges into the steppes, which have their own distinctive forms of animal life. Finally, the faunas of East and Southwest Asia have their own distinguishing characteristics.
                    </p><br/>

                    <dt><h3>The tundra</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Since the tundra subsoil is frozen throughout the year, burrowing animals cannot live there; and, as the tundra is partly free from snow only during the short summer, conditions for life are poor. Most animals, including reindeer, Arctic hares, Arctic foxes, and wolves, live there in summer only and migrate in autumn. Lemmings, however, stay, feeding on the herbage buried beneath the snow. Polar bears are occasionally found throughout the year along the coasts of the Arctic and northern Pacific oceans, where they feed mainly on seals and fish. Hibernation is impossible, for the short summer does not allow enough time for the necessary accumulation of food reserves in the body.

                        Birds are numerous during the summer, but they also desert the tundra in winter—except for such birds as willow grouse and ptarmigans, which live in tunnels in the snow and feed on berries and leaves. Many species of waders, such as gray plovers, the sanderling, and several kinds of sandpipers, migrate to the tundra and breed there in the summer, feeding principally on mosquitoes in the wet areas. Mosquitoes are also the staple food of passerine birds (true perching birds), such as the snow bunting and the Lapland bunting. Gyrfalcons (large Arctic falcons), rough-legged buzzards, and skuas (large dark-coloured rapacious birds of northern seas) prey on those smaller birds and on lemmings. Several kinds of geese and ducks, the Arctic tern, and species of divers occupy the moist parts.

                    <dt><h3>The taiga</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The taiga fauna is much richer than that of the tundra. The taiga is the haunt of brown bears, wolves and foxes, gluttons (a kind of wolverine), otters, ermines, sables, lynx, elk, forest reindeer, hares, and several kinds of squirrels. Birds include species of grouse and woodpeckers and pine grosbeaks, crossbills, siskins, redpolls, red-spotted bluethroats, rubythroats, redwings, fieldfares (medium-sized thrushes), nutcrackers, and Siberian jays. Wading birds include terek sandpipers, which frequent marshes and pools.

                        The rivers of North Asia are inhabited by many common freshwater fishes and by several kinds of sturgeons, including sterlets. Lake Baikal has a unique aquatic life, including many endemic species of sponges, worms, and crustaceans and the Baikal seal (Phoca sibirica).

                        Africa, the second largest continent (after Asia), covering about one-fifth of the total land surface of Earth. The continent is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by the Mediterranean Sea, on the east by the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, and on the south by the mingling waters of the Atlantic and Indian oceans.

                        Africa’s total land area is approximately 11,724,000 square miles (30,365,000 square km), and the continent measures about 5,000 miles (8,000 km) from north to south and about 4,600 miles (7,400 km) from east to west. Its northern extremity is Al-Ghīrān Point, near Al-Abyaḍ Point (Cape Blanc), Tunisia; its southern extremity is Cape Agulhas, South Africa; its farthest point east is Xaafuun (Hafun) Point, near Cape Gwardafuy (Guardafui), Somalia; and its western extremity is Almadi Point (Pointe des Almadies), on Cape Verde (Cap Vert), Senegal. In the northeast, Africa was joined to Asia by the Sinai Peninsula until the construction of the Suez Canal. Paradoxically, the coastline of Africa—18,950 miles (30,500 km) in length—is shorter than that of Europe, because there are few inlets and few large bays or gulfs.

                        Off the coasts of Africa a number of islands are associated with the continent. Of these Madagascar, one of the largest islands in the world, is the most significant. Other, smaller islands include the Seychelles, Socotra, and other islands to the east; the Comoros, Mauritius, Réunion, and other islands to the southeast; Ascension, St. Helena, and Tristan da Cunha to the southwest; Cape Verde, the Bijagós Islands, Bioko, and São Tomé and Príncipe to the west; and the Azores and the Madeira and Canary islands to the northwest.

                        The continent is cut almost equally in two by the Equator, so that most of Africa lies within the tropical region, bounded on the north by the Tropic of Cancer and on the south by the Tropic of Capricorn. Because of the bulge formed by western Africa, the greater part of Africa’s territory lies north of the Equator. Africa is crossed from north to south by the prime meridian (0° longitude), which passes a short distance to the east of Accra, Ghana.

                    <dd>
                        When considered in detail, the movement of air masses and their effects provide the basis for a division of the continent into eight climatic regions. These are the hot desert, semiarid, tropical wet-and-dry, equatorial (tropical wet), Mediterranean, humid subtropical marine, warm temperate upland, and mountain regions.

These are the hot desert, semiarid, tropical wet-and-dry, equatorial (tropical wet), Mediterranean, humid subtropical marine, warm temperate upland, and mountain regions.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Semiarid climatic regions fringe the desert areas and include the greater part of the land south of the Zambezi River. They differ from true desert regions in being just within reach of the ITCZ in the course of its seasonal movement and therefore receiving more rainfall. Temperatures are about the same as those in the desert regions.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The tropical wet-and-dry region is often called the savanna climatic region; this implies, incorrectly, that all areas with savanna vegetation have this type of climate. This region covers a little less than half of the total surface area of the continent, extending toward the Equator from the semiarid areas. The great distinguishing feature of this climatic region is the seasonal character of its rainfall. During the period of high sun, the maritime air masses produce up to six months of rainfall, the length of the rainy season depending on nearness to the Equator. The rest of the year is dry. In a few places—for example, on the coast of Mauritania and Senegal—there is also a little rainfall in the period of low sun. As in the desert and semiarid climatic zones, mean monthly temperatures show less variation than daily temperatures. In western Africa the period of low sun corresponds to the harmattan season. The harmattan is a warm, dry, northeasterly or easterly wind that blows out of the southern Sahara and is frequently laden with large quantities of sand and dust.

                        African vegetation develops in direct response to the interacting effects of rainfall, temperature, topography, and type of soil; it is further modified by the incidence of fire, human agriculture, and grazing and browsing by livestock. Of the total land area of the continent, forests cover about one-fifth; woodlands, bushlands, grasslands, and thickets about two-fifths; and deserts and their extended margins the remaining two-fifths.

                    <dt><h3>Lowland rainforest</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        African lowland rainforests occur along the Guinea Coast of western Africa and in the Congo basin. The full development of this tropical formation requires continuously warm conditions and an annual rainfall exceeding 50 to 60 inches (1,270 to 1,520 millimetres) distributed fairly evenly over the year. The vertical limit is about 3,500 to 4,000 feet. This multistoried, highly diverse, extensive, and potentially self-perpetuating assemblage has been described by some as the source of virtually all tropical floristic diversity. No other part of the world sustains a greater biomass (total weight of organic matter in a given surface area) than lowland tropical rainforests. Even though the speciation (proliferation of distinct types of plant) within the African rainforests is notably poorer than that of its counterparts in Southeast Asia and the Amazon basin of South America, these forests sustain a huge multiplicity of life-forms, occupying different strata (generalized levels of plant height) and niches (separate, small-scale habitats).
                        <br/><br/>
                        Characteristically, tropical rainforest is composed of a ground story, from 6 to 10 feet tall, of shrubs, ferns, and mosses; a middle story of trees and palms 20 to 60 feet in height; and a dominant top canopy consisting of trees up to 150 feet high with straight unbranched trunks, buttressed roots, and spreading crowns of perennial leafage. The large branches of these crowns provide niches for epiphytes, including orchids, ferns, and mosses. Lianas tie trees to one another, parasitic species cling to trunks and branches, and strangler figs (Ficus pretoriae) put down aerial taproots. Nevertheless, these are not “impenetrable” jungles. It has been suggested that some early European travelers and pioneer botanists may have exaggerated the difficulties of human penetration because they journeyed along atypical waterways and along tracks where disturbance of the original vegetation had thickened the regenerating ground layer. In true rainforests, grasses are adventitious (occurring in consequence of fortuitous intrusions). Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) can grow abundantly in areas where the vegetation has been disturbed, providing good fodder for grazing animals when young but quickly becoming rank, coarse, and a refuge for insects. Cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica) is a troublesome grass on depleted and fire-seared ground.

                    <dt><h3>Eastern African forest and bush</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Lowland forests and evergreen bushland form a long belt of land some 125 miles broad along the Indian Ocean. From various causes—notably the monsoonal climate, freely draining soils, and long historical impact of humans—these forests are much more limited in their structure (physical form), speciation, and robustness. On more favoured terrain—such as estuarine fringes, the seaward flanks of the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, and hill masses athwart the rain-bearing southeast monsoon—forest and a close broad-leaved woodland are still dominant. Where land is in a rain shadow, in areas of unfavourable geology (e.g., raised coral reefs), and near cities and small ports, thorny bush, succulent shrubs, and scrawny grassland prevail. Nevertheless, the region now sustains a number of economically important domesticated trees—both indigenous and exotic—such as the coconut palm, cashew, mango, and (especially on Zanzibar and Pemba) clove.  
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h3>Broad-leaved woodland and grassland</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        This classification constitutes one of the most extensive composite categories now recognized and includes much of the land formerly labeled as savanna. Two broad bands extend across the continent, one from about 7° to 12° N latitude and the other from about 8° to 22° S latitude. Structure and floristic composition vary greatly with the increase of latitude, both in the north and the south. Annual rainfall averages 35 to 45 inches, with marked seasonality of occurrence and considerable fluctuations from year to year, both in total rainfall and in the onset of rainy periods. The woodlands of western Africa strikingly resemble those south of the Equator. In both areas, undulating wooded interfluves on light soils successively alternate with swampy, clay-based valley grasslands (called fadamas in Nigeria and dambos in Zambia and Malawi) in a topographically linked sequence of soils called a catena.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Trees, 30 to 50 feet high, are typically deciduous and often fire-resistant, since much of this land is burned annually. Common western African species include types of Isoberlinia (a spreading leguminous tree of the pea family), Daniellia (a leguminous tree with white bark), and Lophira (a tree with strap-shaped leaves that is said to yield the most durable timber in the region). Other hardwoods, forming distinct communities, are Combretum and Terminalia, which are better suited to the drier areas. Prevalent southern equivalents include Brachystegia (a leguminous hardwood, the bark of which formerly was used to make cloth) and Julbernardia (another plant of the pea family resembling Isoberlinia). Over much of the interior of Tanzania, in areas of reduced rainfall and poorer soils, a light-canopied, sustained woodland called Miombo forest rises above a rather scrawny ground layer. This is an excellent habitat for bees, and honey has long been gathered there.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Because of periodic burning, tall grasses have become dominant over large expanses of plateau land, which sometimes contains few, if any, of its original trees. The tall, coarse red grass Hyparrhenia can form prominent stands, but it makes poor grazing land and often harbours insects that spread disease. Much better for the pastoralists are induced swards of Themeda.
                        <br/><br/>
                        For centuries humans have selectively retained certain economically important tree species in areas cleared for farming; the effect has been to create what is called “farmed parkland,” in which a few favoured trees rise above the fields. Examples include the shea butter nut tree (Butyrospermum), common in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire; Acacia albida, found in Senegal and Zambia; and the truly domesticated baobab (Adansonia digitata), which is perhaps the most widely distributed

                    <dt><h3>Thorn woodland, grassland, and semidesert vegetation</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Toward the margins of the tropics, the vegetation cover becomes lower and thinner as the fluctuating transition to desert vegetation ensues. In the same progression the concept of an annual rainfall (nominally 5 to 20 inches) yields to the reality of extreme unreliability in both incidence and expectation. Under such restraints a definitive “boundary” with the desert becomes meaningless. Moreover, there appears to have been a trend toward declining precipitation in the last half of the 20th century, and human impact certainly has enhanced the natural deprivation of plant life in the marginal regions. The southern margin of the Sahara—roughly between the latitudes of 15° and 20°—is called the Sahel (Arabic: Sāḥil; meaning “shore” or “edge”), the word being extended by implication to comprehend the fluctuating margins of the great sand seas of the Sahara to the north. The southern equivalent covers much of the Kalahari, which is often called a desert but is more properly a thirstland.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Thorn woodland displays a predominance of xerophytic, sometimes succulent or semisucculent trees, such as acacia, Commiphora (the myrrh tree), or Boscia (an evergreen hard-leaved tree). The occurrence of the bunched and thorny desert date (Balanites) seems to accompany land impoverishment. A relatively luxuriant shrub layer, often forming dense thickets, is found in conjunction with succulents, such as aloes, Sansevieria (a fibrous species), and Adenium, or desert rose (a succulent shrub with smooth gray bark, a huge water-storing base, and beautiful red or pink flowers), and smaller euphorbias.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Farther toward the desert, tree growth and perennial grass—surviving in narrow strips along watercourses—separate much larger areas of sparse annual grasses (Cenchrus in western Africa, Eragrostis south of the Equator, and Chrysopogon on the margins) and scattered low shrubs, often mainly acacias. Shrubs may often be salt-tolerant. While shrubs may die from inadequate moisture, they are little affected by the rare fires that occur.

                        All high mountains exhibit azonality; i.e., their vegetation differs from that found in the climatic zones from which they rise. The differences manifest themselves as progressive modifications, which are usually well stratified and reflect altitude-dependent climatic changes. Generally, as elevation increases, temperature decreases (to the point where frost and even glaciation can occur) and precipitation increases (although above a certain level precipitation decreases markedly). Mountainous terrain can retain ancient climatic conditions—making possible, for example, the survival of relict species—and the relative inaccessibility of the higher elevations to humans has helped preserve more of the vegetal patterns of the past.

                        Africa includes two regions of the zoographic area known as the Paleotropical realm: the Afrotropical region, which comprises the continent south of the Sahara and the southwestern part of Arabia, and the Madagascan region. The continent also includes a southern part of the Palaearctic (Old World) region of the Holarctic realm (i.e., the lands of the Northern Hemisphere), consisting of northwestern and North Africa south to roughly the Tropic of Cancer.

                    <p>
                        Africa is best known for the enormous diversity and richness of its wildlife. It has a greater variety of large ungulates, or hoofed mammals (some 90 species), and freshwater fish (2,000 species) than any other continent.
                    </p><br/>

                    <dt><h3>Mammals</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The main group of herbivores are the African antelope, which belong to four subfamilies of the ox family (Bovidae). The first subfamily is the oxlike Bovinae, which is further subdivided into the African buffalo and the twist-horned antelope, including the eland (the largest of all antelope), kudu, nyala, and bushbuck. The second subfamily is the duiker, a small primitive bovid that lives in the thickets, bush, and forests. Third is the “horse antelope,” further divided into sabre-horned sable, roan, and oryx antelope; the “deer antelope,” kongonis, hartebeest, topi, gnu (wildebeest), and blesbok, all mostly inhabitants of the open plains; and the “marsh antelope,” waterbuck, lechwe, kob, puku, and reedbuck. The fourth subfamily is the antelope proper, divided into two distinct tribes, the first of which includes royal, dik-dik, klipspringer, oribi, steenbok, and grysbok and the second of which includes gazelle, impala, springbok, and gerenuk. Other well-known large African herbivores include the zebra, giraffe, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and African elephant.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Probably no group of animals is more identified with Africa than its Carnivora (the order of flesh-eating mammals), of which there are more than 60 species. In addition to the better-known big (or roaring) cats—the lion, leopard, and cheetah—are the wild dog, hyena, serval (a long-limbed cat), wildcat, jackal, fox, weasel, civet, and mongoose. These predators and scavengers are vital in maintaining the ecological equilibrium of the areas that they inhabit.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The primates include some 45 species of Old World monkeys, as well as two of the world’s great apes—the chimpanzee and the world’s largest ape, the gorilla. Presimian primates—such as pottos (African lemurs) and galagos (bush babies, or small arboreal lemurs), as well as Lorisidae (a family of arboreal lemurs, moving with a slow, delicate crawl)—are mainly small and nocturnal, but in Madagascar, where there are no true monkeys, the world’s most diverse assemblage of large and small diurnal and nocturnal presimian lemurs survives.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Marine mammals include one Mediterranean and one South African seal (the Cape fur seal) and two Sirenia (an order of aquatic herbivores)—the dugong and the manatee. In addition, whales, porpoises, and dolphins frequent Africa’s coastal waters.
                        <br><br>
                        Africa’s large number of endemic mammal species is second only to that of South America. They include several families of the ungulate order Artiodactyla (composed of mammals with an even number of toes), such as giraffes and hippopotamuses. Some families of Carnivora—such as civets (of the Viverridae family), their smaller relations the genets, and hyenas—are chiefly African. The rodent family of jumping hares (Pedetidae) is endemic, and one order, the aardvark (Tubulidentata)—a large nocturnal burrowing mammal, with one species—is exclusively African. Madagascar also has a remarkable insect-eating family, the tenrecs (animals with long pointed snouts, some of which are spiny and tailless).

                    <dt><h3>Birds of Africa</h3></dt><br/>

                        South of the Sahara the birdlife includes nearly 1,500 resident species, to which must be added another 275 species that are either resident in northwestern Africa or else are Palaearctic winter migrants; the migrants once totaled perhaps two billion individuals, but their numbers have been reduced considerably by severe droughts and by human land use and predation. Birds are mainly of Old World families, but of those that are endemic the most noteworthy are perhaps the ostrich, shoebill, hammerkop (a brown heronlike bird), and secretary bird (a large long-legged predatory bird) and the touracos (brightly coloured birds, some with helmetlike crests). Other families, such as bustards, sand grouse, honey guides (small dull-coloured birds, several species of which are noted for leading people to the nests of honeybees, in order to feed on them after the nests have been broken), and larks, are predominantly African. There are many avian predators of land mammals, including eagles, hawks, and owls; more of fish, such as storks, waders, and a few species of kingfishers; and even more of insects, this latter group usually being of benefit to humans. Scavengers include vultures and the large marabou stork.

                    <dd>
                        Reptiles, of which there are few endemic families, have mainly Old World affinities. Those most likely to be seen include lizards of the agamid family, skinks (a family of lizards characterized by smooth overlapping scales), crocodiles, and tortoises. Endemic reptiles include girdle-tailed and plated lizards. Within the African realm, lizards of the iguana family and boa constrictors occur only in Madagascar. Large vipers are abundant and varied; certain species have extremely toxic venom, but they are seldom encountered. A wealth of both colubrine snakes (with fangs at the posterior end of the upper jaw) and elapine snakes (with fixed poison fangs at the front of the upper jaw) include such highly venomous elapine species as mambas.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Amphibians also belong mainly to Old World groups. Salamanders and hylid tree frogs (having teeth in the upper jaw) are confined to the Palaearctic northwest. Abundant commoner frogs and toads include such oddities as the so-called hairy frog of Cameroon, whose hairs are auxiliary respiratory organs. The frog subfamily Phrynomerinae is exclusively African.

                        Africa possesses an abundant and varied population of arthropods (which include insects and other segmented invertebrates). Among them are found large butterflies of the Charaxes (brush-footed) and Papilio (swallow-tailed) genera, stick insects, and mantises, grasshoppers, driver, or safari, ants (tropical ants that travel in vast, serried ranks), termites, and dung beetles. Spiders abound throughout the continent, and scorpions and locusts can also be plentiful locally. Periodically, huge swarms of locusts spread over wide areas, causing enormous destruction to vegetation. Other serious pests are mosquitoes, which act as vectors in the spread of such human diseases as malaria, and tsetse flies, which transmit the parasite that causes African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in humans and nagana in livestock.

                        The coelacanth, an archaic marine form believed extinct for more than 60 million years, was discovered to be alive off the east coast of South Africa in 1938, and since then many others have been found. A rich and varied invertebrate animal life on the east and west coasts includes marine organisms typical of the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Coral reefs and associated organisms are mainly found in the warm waters of Africa’s east coast, while the southwest and west coasts—washed,respectively, by the cold Benguela and Canary currents—abound in fish.

                        Europe, second smallest of the world’s continents, composed of the westward-projecting peninsulas of Eurasia (the great landmass that it shares with Asia) and occupying nearly one-fifteenth of the world’s total land area. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic Ocean, on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the south (west to east) by the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Kuma-Manych Depression, and the Caspian Sea. The continent’s eastern boundary (north to south) runs along the Ural Mountains and then roughly southwest along the Emba (Zhem) River, terminating at the northern Caspian coast.

                        Europe’s largest islands and archipelagoes include Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land, Svalbard, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the British Isles, the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, Crete, and Cyprus. Its major peninsulas include Jutland and the Scandinavian, Iberian, Italian, and Balkan peninsulas. Indented by numerous bays, fjords, and seas, continental Europe’s highly irregular coastline is about 24,000 miles (38,000 km) long.

                        Among the continents, Europe is an anomaly. Larger only than Australia, it is a small appendage of Eurasia. Yet the peninsular and insular western extremity of the continent, thrusting toward the North Atlantic Ocean, provides—thanks to its latitude and its physical geography—a relatively genial human habitat, and the long processes of human history came to mark off the region as the home of a distinctive civilization. In spite of its internal diversity, Europe has thus functioned, from the time it first emerged in the human consciousness, as a world apart, concentrating—to borrow a phrase from Christopher Marlowe—“infinite riches in a little room.”

                    <dt><h3>Climatic regions</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Four regional European climatic types can be loosely distinguished. However, each is characterized by much local, topographically related variation. The climate in mountainous regions, for instance, is partly determined by elevation, and a variety of climatic types may be “stacked” vertically upon a mountain. Further, the great cities of Europe—because of the scale and grouping of their buildings, their industrial activities, and the layout of their roads—create distinct local climates, including urban “heat islands” (city centres that are warmer than outlying areas) and pollution problems.

                    <dt><h4>Maritime climate</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Characterizing western areas heavily exposed to Atlantic air masses, the maritime type of climate—given the latitudinal stretch of those lands—exhibits sharp temperature ranges. Thus, the January and July annual averages of Reykjavík, Iceland, are about 32 °F (0 °C) and 53 °F (12 °C) respectively, and those of Coruña, Spain, are about 50 °F (10 °C) and 64 °F (18 °C). Precipitation is always adequate—indeed, abundant on high ground—and falls year-round. The greatest amount of precipitation occurs in autumn or early winter. Summers range from warm to hot depending on latitude and elevation, and the weather is changeable everywhere. The maritime climate extends across Svalbard, Iceland, the Faroes, Great Britain and Ireland, Norway, southern Sweden, western France, the Low Countries, northern Germany, and northwestern Spain.

                    </h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The central European, or transitional, type of climate results from the interaction of both maritime and continental air masses and is found at the core of Europe, south and east of the maritime type, west of the much larger continental type, and north of the Mediterranean type. That rugged region has colder winters, with substantial mountain snowfalls, and warmer summers, especially in the lowlands. Precipitation is adequate to abundant, with a summer maximum. The region embraces central Sweden, southern Finland, the Oslo Basin of Norway, eastern France, southwestern Germany, and much of central and southeastern Europe. The range between winter and summer temperatures increases eastward, while the precipitation can exceed 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the mountains, with snow often lying permanently around high peaks. The Danubian region has only modest rainfall (about 24 inches [600 mm] per year at Budapest), but the Dinaric Alps experience heavy cyclonic winter, as well as summer, rain.

                    <dt><h4>Continental climate</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The continental type of climate dominates a giant share of Europe, covering northern Ukraine, eastern Belarus, Russia, most of Finland, and northern Sweden. Winters—much colder and longer, with greater snow cover, than in western Europe—are coldest in the northeast, and summers are hottest in the southeast; the January to July mean temperatures range approximately from 50 to 70 °F (10 to 21 °C). Summer is the period of maximum rain, which is less abundant than in the west; in both the north and southeast of the East European Plain, precipitation reaches only between 10 and 20 inches (250 and 500 mm) annually. In parts of the south, the unreliability of rainfall combines with its relative scarcity to raise a serious aridity problem.

                    <dt><h4>Mediterranean climate</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The subtropical Mediterranean climate characterizes the coastlands of southern Europe, being modified inland (for example, in the Meseta Central, the Apennines, and the North Italian Plain) in response to elevation and aspect. The main features of that climatic region are mild and wet winters, hot and dry summers, and clear skies for much of the year, but marked regional variations occur between the lands of the western and the more southerly eastern basins of the Mediterranean; the former are affected more strongly by maritime air mass intrusions. Rainfall in southern Europe is significantly reduced in areas lying in the lee of rain-bearing westerlies; Rome has an annual mean of roughly 26 inches (660 mm), but Athens has only about 16 inches (400 mm).

                    <dt><h3>Physiographic units of Europe</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Four broad topographic units can be simply, yet usefully, distinguished in the continent of Europe. Those are coastal and interior lowlands, central uplands and plateaus, the northwestern highlands, and southern Europe.
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h4>Central uplands and plateaus
                    </h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The central uplands and plateaus present distinctive landscapes of rounded summits, steep slopes, valleys, and depressions. Examples of such physiographic features can be found in the Southern Uplands of Scotland, the Massif Central of France, the Meseta Central of Spain, and the Bohemian Massif. Routes detour around, or seek gaps through, those uplands—whose German appellation, Horst (“thicket”), recalls their still wooded character, while their coal basins give them great economic importance. The well-watered plateaus give rise to many rivers and are well adapted to pastoral farming. Volcanic rocks add to the diversity of those regions.
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h4>Northwestern highlands
                    </h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The ancient, often mineral-laden rocks of the northwestern highlands, their contours softened by prolonged erosion and glaciation, are found throughout much of Iceland, in Ireland, and in northern and western Britain and Scandinavia. Those highland areas include lands of abundant rainfall—which supplies hydroelectricity and water to industrial cities—and provide summer pastures for cattle. The land in those areas, however, is of little use for crops. The coasts of the northwestern highlands—and in particular the fjords of Norway—invite maritime enterprise.

                    <dt><h4>Southern Europe
                    </h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        A world of peninsulas and islands, southern Europe is subject to its own climatic regime, with fragmented but predominantly mountain and plateau landscapes. The Iberian Peninsula features interior tablelands of Paleozoic rocks that are flanked by mountains of Alpine type. The restricted lowlands lie within interior basins or fringe the coasts; those of Portugal, North Macedonia, Thrace (in the southeastern Balkans), and northern Italy are relatively large. Runoff from the Alps furnishes much water for electricity-generating stations as well as for the flow regimes of major rivers.

                        The terms “natural,” “original,” and “primitive,” as epithets applied to the vegetation of Europe, have no precise meaning unless they are related to a specific time in geologic history. It is nevertheless possible to envisage continental vegetation zones as they formed and acquired some stability during postglacial times, although such zones are only rarely recalled by present-day remnants.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Tundra vegetation, made up of lichens and mosses, occupies a relatively narrow zone in Iceland and the extreme northern portions of Russia and Scandinavia, although that zone is continued southward in the mountains of Norway. Vegetation of a similar kind occurs at elevations of 5,000 to 6,000 feet (1,500 to 1,800 metres) in the Alps and the northern Urals.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Southward, the virtually treeless tundra merges into the boreal forest, or taiga. The more northerly zone is “open,” with stands of conifers and with willows and birch thickets rising above a lichen carpet. It is most extensive in northern Russia but continues, narrowing westward, across Sweden. South of that zone, and without an abrupt transition, the “closed” boreal forest occupies a large fraction—mainly north of the upper Volga River—of Russia and Scandinavia. Thin-leaved and cold-resistant conifers, together with birch, predominate.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The northern vegetation may superficially suggest its primeval character, but the zone of mixed forest that once stretched across the continent from Great Britain and Ireland to central Russia has been changed extensively by humans. Surviving patches of woodland—associations of broad-leaved trees and some conifers, summarily described as Atlantic, central, and eastern—hint at the formerly extensive cover. Indeed, although as much as 80 percent of Europe’s land was once forested, in the early 21st century various forests (including both boreal and mixed types) covered only about 30 percent of the continent.

                        In southern Europe, Mediterranean vegetation has a distinctive character, containing broad-leaved evergreen trees and shrubs as well as areas of scrub. Around the sea that vegetation is called maquis; it includes aromatic plants and small trees such as olives and figs. Scrub is scattered because of summer drought, particularly in areas where the soil is underlain by limestone or where there is little, if any, soil.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The wooded-steppe and grass-steppe vegetation zones are confined primarily to southwestern Russia and Ukraine, although they also extend into the Danubian lowlands (see the Steppe). Semidesert vegetation characterizes the dry lowland around the northern and northwestern shores of the Caspian Sea.

                    <dd>  
                        The tundra belt extends still farther south on higher ground. In the Arctic, tundra in the Ural Mountains begins at about 3,000 feet (900 metres), but at latitude 53° N it begins at 4,250 feet (1,300 metres). Tundra extends over large areas of the Chersky, Verkhoyansk, and Kamchatka mountain ranges.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The primeval vegetation of Europe began to take shape as the climate ameliorated following the retreat of the Pleistocene ice sheets some 12,000 years ago. The microscopic study of pollen grains preserved in datable layers of peat and sediments has made it possible to trace the continental spread, in response to climatic improvement, of forest-forming trees. The double barrier of the Alps and the Mediterranean Sea had checked the southward retreat of trees at the onset of the ice ages, and there were relatively few indigenous species to return northward from unglaciated refuges. In the first postglacial climatic phase (the Boreal), spruce, fir, pine, birch, and hazel nevertheless established themselves as far north as central Sweden and Finland. During the succeeding climatic optimum (the Atlantic phase), which was probably wetter and certainly somewhat warmer, mixed forests of oak, elm, common lime (linden), and elder spread northward. Only in the late Atlantic period did the beech and hornbeam spread into western and central Europe from the southeast.
                        <br/><br/>
                        During postglacial times, therefore, when small numbers of humans were living within Europe, the continental surface was thickly clad with trees and undergrowth, except where tree growth was precluded by extreme cold, high elevation, bad drainage, or exposure to persistent gales. Even those areas where windblown loess was deeply deposited are now known to have had woods of beech, hawthorn, juniper, box, and ash, as did limestone plateaus. The Mediterranean peninsulas also had evergreen and mixed forests rooted in an ample soil.

                    <dt><h3>Role of humans
                    </h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd> 
                        From prehistoric times onward, with ever-increasing force, humans, seeking optimum economic use of available resources, have acted as a vigorous agent of vegetation change. The effects of grazing animals may well explain why some heathlands (e.g., the Lüneburg Heath in north-central Germany) replaced primeval forest. By fire and later by ax, forest clearance met demands for building materials for homes and ships, for fuel, for charcoal for iron smelting, and, not least, for more available land for cultivation and pasture. The mixed forests suffered most because their relatively rich soils and long and warm growing season promised good returns from cultivation. The destruction of woodlands was markedly strong when population was growing (as between about 800 and 1300 CE). It was later intensified by German colonization east of the Rhine and reached maximum scale in the 19th century. In southern Europe—where naval demands were continuous and sources of suitable timber sharply localized—tree cutting entailed, from Classical antiquity onward, serious soil loss through erosion, increased aridity, floods, and marsh formation. Farther north throughout the continent, as present distribution of arable land shows, forests were reduced to remnants; only in the north and below the snow line of Alpine mountains have forests of large and continuing commercial value survived. Another drastic vegetation change brought about by humans has been the virtual elimination of the wooded and grass steppes, which have become vast granaries.
                        <br/><br/>
                        On the more positive side may be noted the reclamation of marshlands and the improvement of the soil, through agriculture, of some hill grasslands and heaths. In timber-deficient countries the afforestation of hillslopes, chiefly with quickly growing conifers, has restored some of the former forests. Second-growth forests also have come to occupy some areas where poor agricultural land has been abandoned.

                    <dt><h3>Plant imports
                    </h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Humans have not only shaped the vegetation zones of Europe. They also have introduced many of the individual species of plants, both wild and cultivated, that commonly grow on the continent. To a perhaps surprising degree, European vegetation comprises a large number of plants originally from other parts of the world. Although some imported crops—notably citrus fruits, sugarcane, and rice—can grow only marginally in Europe, and then by irrigation, many others thrive throughout the continent. Originating as wild grasses in Ethiopia, cultivated varieties of wheat and barley reached Europe early, via the Middle East and Egypt, as did the olive, the grape, figs, flax, and some varieties of vegetables. Rice, sugarcane, and cotton, of tropical Indian origin, were introduced by the Arabs and Moors, especially into Spain. Citrus fruits, peaches, mulberries, oats, and millet reached Europe from their original Chinese habitats, and Europe owes corn (maize), tobacco, squashes, tomatoes, red peppers, prickly pears, agave (sisal), and potatoes—first grown for fodder but destined to become the cheap staple food for the large families of low-paid workers of the 19th century—to the Americas. Europe has drawn greatly on East Asia and North America for trees, especially ornamental trees, while some acacias and the eucalyptus derive from Australia. The commercially important sugar beet, however, was developed in Europe in the 18th century; its cultivation increased greatly in the following century, particularly after the British blocked the importation of cane sugar during the Napoleonic Wars.

                    <dd>
                        With animals as with plants, the earlier Pleistocene range and variety has been much reduced by the expansion of human settlement. Wild fauna has been long in retreat since Upper Paleolithic times (beginning about 40,000 years ago), when, as cave drawings portray, small human groups held their own against such big game as aurochs and mammoths, now extinct, and also against such survivors as bison, horses, and boars. Hares, swans, and geese were also hunted, and salmon, trout, and pike were fished. Humans were, inevitably, the successful competitor for land use. By prolonged effort, settlers won the land for crops and for domesticated animals, and they hunted animals, especially for furs. As population mounted in industrializing Europe, humans no less inevitably destroyed, or changed drastically, the wild vegetation cover and the animal life. With difficulty, and largely on human sufferance, animals have nevertheless survived in association with contemporary vegetation zones.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the tundra some reindeer (caribou), both wild and domesticated, are well equipped to withstand the cold. Their spoon-shaped hooves are useful for finding food in rough ground. Their herds migrate southward in winter and eat lichens and plants as well as flesh, notably that of lemmings and voles. Arctic foxes, bears, ermines, partridge, and snowy owls may appear in the tundra, where, in the short summer, seabirds, river fish, and migrant birds (swans, ducks, and snipes) vitalize a harsh environment, then made almost intolerable by swarms of biting midges.

                    <dt><h3>Domesticated animals</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd> 
                        Livestock are selectively bred and raised with some regard to the physical character of their environment as well as to market demands and government decisions. In the far north, herds of reindeer provide meat, milk, pelts, wool, and bone to the Sami people. In the rough hilly scrubland of Mediterranean Europe, sheep, goats, donkeys, mules, and asses are common. The horse, which in its long history has drawn chariots, carried mounted knights, and hauled plows, wagons, artillery, stagecoaches, canal boats, and urban trams, is now raised more for racing, riding, ceremonial uses, and the hunting of fox and stag but is still used for farm work, especially in eastern Europe. Distribution maps of animals kept on farms show how widely they enter into agriculture: sheep have a special concentration in Great Britain and the Balkan countries, and cattle have a small place in southern Europe, while pigs are relatively numerous in the north, especially in the highly populated areas of Germany, Denmark, and the Low Countries.

                        North America, third largest of the world’s continents, lying for the most part between the Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer. It extends for more than 5,000 miles (8,000 km) to within 500 miles (800 km) of both the North Pole and the Equator and has an east-west extent of 5,000 miles. It covers an area of 9,355,000 square miles (24,230,000 square km).North America occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World, the Western Hemisphere, or simply the Americas. Mainland North America is shaped roughly like a triangle, with its base in the north and its apex in the south; associated with the continent is Greenland, the largest island in the world, and such offshore groups as the Arctic Archipelago, the West Indies, Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands), and the Aleutian Islands.
                        <br/><br/>
                        North America is bounded on the north by the Arctic Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean. To the northeast Greenland is separated from Iceland by the Denmark Strait, and to the northwest Alaska is separated from the Asian mainland by the much narrower Bering Strait. North America’s only land connection is to South America at the narrow Isthmus of Panama. Denali (Mount McKinley) in Alaska, rising 20,310 feet (6,190 metres) above sea level, is the continent’s highest point, and Death Valley in California, at 282 feet (86 metres) below sea level, is its lowest. North America’s coastline of some 37,000 miles (60,000 km)—the second longest of the continents after Asia—is notable for the great number of indentations, particularly in the northern half.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The name America is derived from that of the Italian merchant and navigator Amerigo Vespucci, one of the earliest European explorers to visit the New World. Although at first the term America was applied only to the southern half of the continent, the designation soon was applied to the entire landmass. Those portions that widened out north of the Isthmus of Panama became known as North America, and those that broadened to the south became known as South America. According to some authorities, North America begins not at the Isthmus of Panama but at the narrows of Tehuantepec, with the intervening region called Central America. Under such a definition, part of Mexico must be included in Central America, although that country lies mainly in North America proper. To overcome this anomaly, the whole of Mexico, together with Central and South American countries, also may be grouped under the name Latin America, with the United States and Canada being referred to as Anglo-America. This cultural division is a very real one, yet Mexico and Central America (including the Caribbean) are bound to the rest of North America by strong ties of physical geography. Greenland also is culturally divided from, but physically close to, North America. Some geographers characterize the area roughly from the southern border of the United States to the northern border of Colombia as Middle America, which differs from Central America because it includes Mexico. Some definitions of Middle America also include the West Indies.
                        <br/><br/>
                        North America contains some of the oldest rocks on Earth. Its geologic structure is built around a stable platform of Precambrian rock called the Canadian (Laurentian) Shield. To the southeast of the shield rose the ancient Appalachian Mountains; and to the west rose the younger and considerably taller Cordilleras, which occupy nearly one-third of the continent’s land area. In between these two mountain belts are the generally flat regions of the Great Plains in the west and the Central Lowlands in the east.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The continent is richly endowed with natural resources, including great mineral wealth, vast forests, immense quantities of fresh water, and some of the world’s most fertile soils. These have allowed North America to become one of the most economically developed regions in the world, and its inhabitants enjoy a high standard of living. North America has the highest average income per person of any continent and an average food intake per person that is significantly greater than that of other continents. Although it is home to less than 10 percent of the world’s population, its per capita consumption of energy is almost four times as great as the world average.
                        <br/><br/>
                        North America’s first inhabitants are believed to have been ancient Asiatic peoples who migrated from Siberia to North America sometime during the last glacial advance, known as the Wisconsin Glacial Stage, the most recent major division of the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). The descendants of these peoples, the various Native American and Eskimo (Inuit) groups, largely have been supplanted by peoples from the Old World. People of European ancestry constitute the largest group, followed by those of African and of Asian ancestry; in addition there is a large group of Latin Americans, who are of mixed European and Native American ancestry.

                        Differing continental climatic regions reflect the considerable amount of Arctic land, the great spread of temperate conditions, and the small but significant tropical area; dry climates also stand out in strong contrast to the prevailingly humid ones.

                    <dt><h4>The Arctic zone</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Including the northern parts of the Canadian Shield and Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and Greenland, the Arctic zone is dominated by Arctic and polar continental air masses and is perennially cold or cool. Temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) last 5 to 7 months, and subfreezing temperatures can persist for 8 to 10 months. Only between June and September do temperatures frequently rise above 32 °F (0 °C). The frost-free season does not exceed 60 days. Precipitation is low—especially in the far north—with 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm) of summer rain plus 30 to 60 inches (760 to 1,500 mm) of winter snow.
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h4>The cool temperate zone</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The cool temperate zone extends from Newfoundland to Alaska and from Hudson Bay to the Ohio River. It is dominated by the polar continental air mass, especially during the long, cold winters. After the period of “Indian summer” that continues into October, temperatures fall quickly and do not rise substantially until April or early May. In January and February they drop to below 32 °F (0 °C) in the Ohio River valley and below 0 °F (−18 °C) north of the Great Lakes, with minimum temperatures as low as −20 to −80 °F (−29 to −62 °C). Winter killing of crops and spring and autumn frosts are a hazard in the Canadian parts of the region, where the frost-free season is from 90 to 120 days. A swift transition occurs with spring; tropical gulf air raises monthly mean temperatures to more than 50 °F (10 °C) in June and to more than 60 °F (16 °C) in July. Precipitation is moderate, from 15 to 35 inches (380 to 900 mm); as evaporation is low, however, most precipitation is effective for plant growth. The maximum precipitation occurs in summer and fall, when the James Bay, Alberta, and Wyoming storm tracks are activated and when moist gulf air is in place.

                    <dt><h4>The warm temperate zone</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        On the southeast coasts of the United States, the warm temperate zone extends to the Mississippi River and over the Gulf Coast; the zone is strongly influenced by the warm, moist tropical air mass that originates over the Gulf of Mexico. The long frost-free season exceeds 200 days. Tropical air spreads north in February and dominates the region until November, when polar continental air occasionally invades. Winters are mild, with January means of 40 to 54 °F (4 to 12 °C). July averages are tropical, with highs exceeding 80 °F (28 °C).
                        <br/><br/>
                        This warmth and the long growing season allow subtropical crops such as cotton and peanuts (groundnuts) to be grown. Rainfall is ample (40 to 60 inches [1,000 to 1,500 mm]) and benefits from the presence of the Colorado and Texas low-pressure systems and from thunderstorms that flare up on warm afternoons in the tropical maritime air. Because the landmass is intensely heated, frequent thunderstorms dot the landscape in this region, especially in early summer. Hurricanes are an annual hazard along the Gulf of Mexico and up the lower Mississippi valley.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the American Southwest a Mediterranean type of climate is found. Summers are dry there, because tropical continental air is dominant. July means of 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C) are typical, with bright, sunny skies. Winters are mild (45 to 50 °F [7 to 10 °C]) and somewhat wet, with polar Pacific airs swinging south and bringing occasional heavy rain. Frost and snowfall are rare but may occur when polar continental air thrusts through to the coast. Los Angeles has a record low temperature of only 23 °F (−5 °C). Annual rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches (380 to 760 mm), along with high evaporation rates, often are insufficient for growing crops during the summer; supplemental irrigation is necessary.

                    <dt><h4>The tropical humid climate</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Central America, with its tropical humid climate, has no real winter; even the coldest month averages above 64 °F (18 °C). With summers of 80 to 82 °F (27 to 28 °C), the mean annual temperature range is lower than the usual daily range, a characteristic which is markedly different from most of North America. Rainfall is ample and regular, with 45 to 80 inches (1,100 to 2,000 mm) where the easterly trade winds blow onshore. Lee valleys, however, often are quite dry. Summer hurricanes frequently occur, causing much damage.

                    <dt><h4>Dry climates</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        About one-third of North America, including the high Arctic latitudes, has a dry climate. Chief dry areas lie in the American Southwest, where a combination of the midlatitude high-pressure belt, the tropical continental air mass, and rain shadow effects behind the high Sierra Nevada has led to lack of rainfall. Summer winds blow from the continent outward, discounting the effect of Pacific subtropical air. As the winds move down in altitude from high interior plateaus, they become drier and warmer. The intermontane region of the United States and Mexico, from the Columbia River basin to Guadalajara, and the Pacific coast from San Diego, California, south to Mazatlán, Mexico, are therefore arid, receiving less than 10 inches (250 mm) of rain per year. Some years have no rain. The Great Plains, from the South Saskatchewan River to Mexico, are semiarid, with 8 to 15 inches (200 to 380 mm) of rainfall; the high mid-continental jet stream usually is depressed southward over them, strengthening down-moving dry wind from across the Rockies and tending to fend off cyclones from tropical gulf or polar continental air masses. The high Arctic areas are dry because most of the open water (which could act as a source of moisture) is frozen for six to nine months of the year and because the cold air that dominates the region can hold little moisture.

                    <dt><h3>Relief</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The central shield, named the Canadian or Laurentian Shield by geologists, consists of a low plateau (averaging about 1,400 feet [400 metres] in elevation) that is tilted at its edges and is most depressed at Hudson Bay, its centre. It has a rough surface of old, worn mountains and domes that rise above flat, geologically ancient basins. The shield represents an area that has undergone extensive erosion and sculpting by ice and weathering processes. The southern edge has the mountainous Algomans and Laurentians (more than 2,000 feet [600 metres] high) and rises to above 5,000 feet (1,500 metres) in the great dome of the Adirondacks. The eastern edge is somewhat higher, rising to nearly 6,000 feet (1,800 metres) in the Torngats and more than 7,000 feet (2,100 metres) on Baffin Island; in Greenland too it tilts up to more than 6,000 feet. The western rim is much lower, reaching only about 600 feet (180 metres) in parts. The Snare and Nonacho ranges west of Hudson Bay lift the edge of the plateau to nearly 2,000 ft. Faulting broke the northern rim into a series of prongs, extending into southeastern Ellesmere Island and across Victoria Island, with sea-drowned channels and low sedimentary basins in between, forming the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The entire shield was under successive ice sheets during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago), and its high eastern rim still contains relics of these glacial advances and retreats. Ice-cut valleys in the higher areas, ice-plucked basins everywhere, and ice-deposited ridges known as eskers and drumlins point to a major centre of ice accumulation and dispersion over central Labrador, still noted for its heavy snow cover. This is where the great continental glaciers originated. Greenland also was a main centre of glacial advance and retreat, while Keewatin in western Canada was an important secondary focus. Much of the shield has been scraped bare by glacial erosion; smooth, bare bedrock surfaces are commonplace. After most of the ice had melted and its tremendous weight had been lifted from the crust, portions of the shield began to rise, leaving traces of former beaches along the coasts of Greenland, Baffin Island, Labrador, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence; these provided narrow but vital benches for human settlement. Ice-cut rock basins have left countless lakes, and parts of the surface of the central shield are almost more water than land.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Erosion also profoundly altered the marginal mountains. The Appalachians have been planed down to such an extent that their crest lines are smooth-topped for hundreds of miles. In Canada the highest level lies at about 4,000 feet (1,200 metres), in the flattops of the Shickshocks (French: Chic-Chocs); another level exists at 2,000 feet (600 metres) on Mount Carleton; and lower ones lie at roughly 1,100 feet (300 metres) and 600 feet (180 metres) in the Acadian ranges. In New England, mountains like Mounts Washington and Monadnock, which are composed of highly resistant rock, rise above a broad mass of ridges at just above the 2,000-foot level; those ridges, in turn, rise above the 1,100 foot-high New England Upland. Pleistocene glaciation deepened and straightened the valleys, strewing their sides and parts of the coast with debris. Portions of sea-buried end moraines, which mark the limit of the tonguing glaciers, form offshore banks and islands east and south of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New England. The unglaciated Appalachian Mountains—i.e., those located south of the Susquehanna River—have long flat-topped summits at elevations of about 2,500 feet (750 metres) and broad terraces at 500 to 600 feet (150 to 180 metres). The Ridge and Valley section’s pattern of drainage consists of short, deep gaps across the ridges and long parallel stretches in between. East of the Blue Ridge extends the Piedmont Upland, terminating abruptly in the fall line, where its rivers plunge down over rapids or falls to the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The Hudson-Mohawk gap represents a major break between the northern and the southern Appalachians and affords a natural point of entry to the interior of the continent.

                        Taking up about one-third of North America, the Cordilleras completely dominate Alaska and Central America and swell out widely in the United States as the Rocky Mountains.
                        In Canada the Cordilleras consist of six well-marked zones: (1) the 10,000- to 12,000-foot- (3,000- to 3,700-metre-) high Rocky Mountains, continuing north into the Brooks Range of Alaska, (2) the Rocky Mountain Trench, a profound fault feature forming the headwaters of the Columbia, Fraser, Peace, and Yukon rivers, (3) the interior uplands and old fold mountains from the Selkirk and Okanogan ranges in the south to the Cassiar Mountains and the Yukon Plateau in the north, mostly lying at elevations of about 2,400 feet (700 metres) but with ridges above 8,000 feet (2,400 metres), (4) the Coast Mountains, extending north into the Alaska Range and including lofty volcanoes in the north, (5) the Inside Passage from Puget Sound to Alaska, which is possibly a downfaulted zone flooded by the sea, and (6) a structurally complex outer island arc, running from Vancouver Island to the Aleutian Islands. The magnificent scenery of the northern Rocky Mountains, including U-shaped valleys often extending westward into sea-drowned fjords, has resulted from frequent glaciation, and some areas still nurse sizable glaciers.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the United States, the Rockies, typified by flat or gently folded sedimentary rocks, sweep south from Canada into northern Montana as the Lewis Range. They then change to a group of domes or long anticlines with “parks” or broad basins between them. This park-and-dome area is characterized by the “peeling back” of younger rocks from the cores of much older, primary rocks at the heart of the upfolded anticlines. The southern Rockies have striking volcanic peaks. West of the Rockies and east of the Pacific Coast Ranges is a vast region of intermontane plateaus, extending from eastern Washington state to northern Mexico. The immense lava tablelands of the central Columbia–Snake River basin are known as the Columbia Plateau. To the south lie the Basin and Range Province and the Colorado Plateau. The former, extending from southern Oregon and Idaho to northern Mexico, apparently is the result of the splitting of a broad central plateau by a great number of fault-block ridges, the slopes of which plunge under basins partly filled with debris that has been weathered and transported downslope from the ridges. The region includes all of the continent’s major deserts. The Colorado Plateau is a massive feature with a series of relatively flat-bedded tablelands, made steplike by faulting action and intruded by domes of igneous rocks. Its slow rate of uplift was matched by the steady downcutting of the Colorado River and its tributaries, producing the Grand Canyon—one of the most spectacular gorges in the world. Westward rise the mountains of the Sierra Nevada, which reach to nearly 15,000 feet (4,500 metres), are intensively folded and faulted, and continue north in the Cascade Range, which is marked by some of North America’s most beautiful volcanic cones. Seaward of this mountain zone is a line of depressions marked by Puget Sound, the Central Valley of California, and the Gulf of California. These are separated by knots of volcanoes, as in the Klamath Mountains, and enclosed by the ranges along the Pacific coast, including the Olympic Mountains of Washington. This whole area has been profoundly faulted because it lies near the western edge of the North American tectonic plate, which is grinding against the offshore Pacific plate. Along some of the faults, notably the San Andreas, earthquake shocks occur, and occasionally these have produced devastating results.

                        In Mexico the folded ranges of the Sierra Madre to the west and east of the central Mexican Plateau terminate in the grandeur of a mass of high volcanoes of 15,000 to 17,000 feet (4,570 to 5,200 metres) located to the south of the fertile lake-filled basins of Guadalajara and Mexico City. The Balsas River basin then makes a distinct break. To the south the Sierra Madre del Sur and the mountains of Guatemala and Honduras exhibit a west-east trend. This structural region includes a sweep of fold mountains of 4,000 to 6,000 feet (1,200 to 1,800 metres), with Caribbean extensions in Jamaica, southern Cuba, the island of Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. These mountains swing southward through the West Indies, a chain of volcanic islands fringed with coral reefs or limestone plateaus. Another arc, of two lines of fold mountains on either side of a trench through western Nicaragua, dominates Central America and links it with the folds of western Colombia in South America.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Irregular ridges of coarse morainic deposits mark the outer limits of the advance of the Cordilleran ice sheets, which swept down preexisting river valleys in the Rockies. Broad, low moraines also mark the southern limit of the larger, thicker continental sheets, which advanced south out of Canada. The long tonguing loops of end moraines of the continental ice sheet are prominent features north of the Missouri and Ohio rivers—some running for hundreds of miles and standing 300 or 400 feet (90 or 120 metres) above the plains. Several glacial advances—at least three major ones but perhaps as many as eight or more—successively covered the lowlands with glacial drift.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Glaciers began advancing into the mid-continent as early as two million years ago. Deposits left by some of these early ice sheets now lie buried in Iowa and Minnesota and crop out as old low-relief landscapes in eastern Kansas and Nebraska. Later, the “superglaciation” known as the Illinoian advanced as far south as southern Illinois about 135,000 years ago. Finally, the last major advance of the ice—the Wisconsin glaciation—began about 115,000 years ago and left behind most of the hills, valleys, and surficial glacial deposits in the upper Great Lakes region. By about 7,000 years ago it was essentially gone. Meltwaters from this ice sheet occasionally ponded in front of the wasting ice mass, leading to vast, flat lake plains that have been drained and are now intensively farmed—for example, the plains west of Toledo, Ohio, or the vast flatlands of Lake Agassiz in eastern North Dakota and southern Manitoba. Major river valleys that carried summertime meltwaters, such as the Missouri, Illinois, Wabash, and Mississippi, dried up in winter, allowing the cold winds to blow silty river sediment onto the uplands. Today much of the Midwest’s fertile soils have formed in deep deposits of this windblown glacial silt, known as loess.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the ice-free areas, lowlands formed because of the continued action of rivers. Streams debouching from the Rockies have spread sands, occasionally whipped up into sand hills, well beyond their banks; those funneling into the Mississippi River have created a vast plain that is known as the Mississippi delta. In addition, the Coastal Plain is marked by lines of sand hills, which are the relics of stranded beaches that eroded as the plains were lifted slowly out of the seas in postglacial times.

                        North American vegetation communities and their associated fauna are closely allied to soil, as their habitats, too, reflect the powerful influences of climate. Forests dominate the humid regions and once covered about two-thirds of North America; grassland, scrub, desert vegetation, or tundra typify the dry third of the continent.

                    <dt><h3>The Pacific coniferous forest</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>  
                        Offering one of the great spectacles of the continent, the Pacific coniferous forest consists of immense redwoods and firs forming vast cathedral-like groves, where the tall trunks rise hundreds of feet like great pillars to support a canopy of evergreen branches overhead. A long growing season, moderate temperatures, and a heavy, constant supply of moisture have combined to foster the tallest and largest trees found in North America. Redwood and western cedar along the north coast of California give way to Douglas fir and western hemlock from Oregon to British Columbia and Sitka spruce in Alaska. In the south, red-stemmed arbutuses lend a Mediterranean touch; giant-leaved maple, oak, and ash are common in the middle sector; and birch and aspen are the subdominants in the north. This coastal forest is one of the continent’s chief sources of construction timber. It also is a major source of pulp and paper and a home for large numbers of red deer and mountain elk and also for black bears, lynx, and beavers. Fish-eating hawks and eagles abound. North America’s greatest runs of salmon are seen there, as the fish swarm upstream to spawn in mountain lakes, and off Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands) lies one of the continent’s chief halibut fisheries. The meeting of the Kuroshio, a warm current from across the Pacific, with the cool water along the western offshore deeps provides ideal conditions for abundant fish life. The faulted and glaciated coasts, with great fjords and perennial rivers, attract fish inland and thus facilitate fishing.

                    <dt><h3>The boreal forest</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd> 
                        One of the greatest sweeps of forest in the world, the boreal forest (or taiga) extends in a vast and virtually unbroken sheet of green eastward from the Aleutian Islands through Alaska and northern Canada to the island of Newfoundland. Its conifers are much shorter than those of the Pacific Coast but grow in denser, sometimes almost impenetrable, stands. The boreal forest essentially is the domain of spruce and balsam fir, with various species of pine becoming significant in the west and jack pine and tamarack in the east; interspersed among the conifers are such deciduous species as white birch and aspen. From Alaska through the Mackenzie plains to Keewatin, white spruce dominates; through eastern Canada and upland New England, the black spruce is common, especially on wet soils. The region is the Western Hemisphere’s greatest source of pulpwood.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Great herds of caribou shelter in the northern fringes of this forest in the winter. They are preyed upon by packs of timber wolves. Farther south, deer, elk, and moose are still common, though their numbers have been reduced by humans. Both black and brown bears are frequently seen, especially in berry patches. Many fur-bearing animals, including martens, mink, beavers, muskrats, and squirrels, can be found. In the spring pickerel run up the rivers to spawn, and lake trout and whiting live in the cool, deep waters of the innumerable northern lakes. Whitefish are caught in great numbers in Great Slave Lake, but because of pollution they are much less prevalent in the Great Lakes than they once were. Cod and haddock are found in vast numbers on the banks off Newfoundland southward to New England, where the cold Labrador Current mixes with part of the warm Gulf Stream, thus stimulating aquatic conditions and encouraging fish life.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The boreal forest is home to an enormous bird population. Year-round residents include species of jay, owl, raven, and woodpecker, while summer migratory birds include such waterfowl as the common loon, mallard duck, and Canada goose and large flocks of warblers and other songbirds. Summer also brings huge swarms of blackflies and mosquitoes, which are a nuisance to humans but are an important food source for fish and birds.

                    <dt><h3>The Cordilleran forest</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The Cordilleran forest lies between the Pacific coniferous forest and the northern Great Plains and is south of the interior boreal forest. On the west it is made up of cedar and Douglas fir, with Sitka and Engelmann spruce at higher elevations; while, in the east, it has more pine and spruce, with lodgepole pine and white spruce making close, straight-limbed stands. On the intermontane plateaus and ridges, western hemlock and yellow or sugar pine form groves with parkland between. Elevation and aspect dictate tree distribution, with tall and dense fir woods occurring on the wetter faces at lower levels, spruce blanketing the higher slopes, and pine abundant mainly on the drier exposures. At elevations above the tree line, scattered clumps of subalpine firs are found in sheltered areas, these giving way to alpine tundra at higher elevations and ultimately to ice and snow on the highest peaks and cirques. Animal life is rich there, as this region is the continent’s chief game preserve. Species include elk and deer in the fir-spruce forests, antelope in the open parkland, and goats high up in the alpine pastures. Preying on these are the mountain lion and the occasional pack of wolves. The grizzly bear keeps to higher and less-accessible haunts, but the black bear is common in the lower forests. This forest is one of the few remaining habitats of the wolverine. Mountain trout are abundant in streams.

                    <dd>
                        Tropical rainforests provide a dense covering of all windward slopes in southern Mexico and Central America. The forests consist of such tall, broad-leaved evergreen trees as mahogany, ironwood, and palm, which form a spreading canopy over a lower tier of tree ferns, grape bays, gum trees, rattans, and mangroves laced with lianas and covered with epiphytes. Numerous species of plants are widely scattered in the forest, as community diversity is very high in this environment. Wildlife also is varied, with a great number of parrots, cockatoos and nutcrackers, troops of monkeys, and many snakes and iguanas. Leopards are still common. Ants, beetles, and flies feed on the decaying vegetation, and bacterial activity is high. This is an environment in which such tropical diseases as yellow fever, malaria, and blackwater fever historically have taken a heavy toll. A dry, tropical scrub of thorn trees, cacti, and sagebrush often replaces forest across a remarkably short distance on leeward slopes and in rain shadow basins.

                        Located in patches in subhumid parts of Central America, tropical savannas usually occur at the intermediate levels of the lee slopes of mountains and on plateaus. They are significant in Guatemala and the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. Heavy, though short-lived, summer rains bring on a thick, rapid growth of tall grasses; cyclones associated with the northeastern trade winds bring enough rain during the rest of the year to maintain a thin cover. Fires and hurricanes frequently disturb vegetation on the savannas and help to limit the density of the tree population.

                    <dt><h3>Temperate grasslands</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd> 
                        The temperate grasslands, or prairies, form a belt between forest and desert, mainly on the Great Plains but also on the mid-slopes of the intermontane basins, above the salty desert flats. At the “break of the plains” on the eastern subhumid margin, invaded by rain-bearing tropical gulf air in spring and early summer, the grasslands consist of a dense growth of tall grasses, such as big and little bluestem and Indian grass, along with many forbs and some small berry bushes, wild roses, and stunted aspen trees. These are the tallgrass prairies that once were home to most of America’s bison, before hunters virtually exterminated the species. Wet prairie exists in the middle Mississippi basin, where the annual rainfall exceeds 30 inches (760 mm); its origin has been attributed to repeated burnings by Plains Indians to stampede bison in mass hunts, to burn off trees and thicken the grass to provide pasture, or to expedite travel. Farther west, where rainfall drops below 17 inches (430 mm) in Texas and 15 inches (380 mm) in Alberta, vegetation is less luxuriant, and midgrass and shortgrass prairies are typical. In the westernmost parts of the plains, grasses are found only in bunches, with areas of generally bare ground and gravel between. The vegetation is made up of bluestem bunchgrass, thin needlegrass, and tough grama and wire grasses, along with patches of cacti, sagebrush, or, farther south, mesquite grass. These regions still pasture many small antelopes, although they mainly have been turned into rangeland for cattle or sheep. Prairie dogs still inhabit some areas. Burrowing insects, such as ants, and mammals are quite common.

                    <dd>
                        Desert vegetation is found in intermontane basins and along arid coasts of the western United States and in northern Mexico. Extensive salt flats and mountains with rocky soils make this a harsh environment for all but the most drought-tolerant plants. Frost and snow are not uncommon in the Great Basin Desert of Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming, which is dominated by sagebrush and scattered short grasses. Creosote bush, saltbush, mesquite, yucca, and many species of cacti, including the treelike saguaro, are common in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts of Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. The rocky, cool Mojave Desert of southeastern California is home to the Joshua tree. Animal life is primarily reptilian and tends to be nocturnal. The desert tortoise, now endangered, is the “showpiece” large reptile of the region.

                    <dd>
                        Across northern Canada and on the many islands in the Arctic Ocean lies a vast marshy plain called the tundra. There the growing season is only 45 to 60 days, and frost is possible year-round. Too cold for trees, this community contains only a few plant species, such as sedge, moss, lichen, cotton grass, and heath. In sheltered areas willow and alder shrubs and some dwarf birches are found. Shallow permafrost inhibits infiltration of the meagre amounts of meltwater and rainfall into the ground. This, coupled with the flatness of the tundra landscape, make for wet, boggy conditions throughout much of the growing season. Biting flies, mosquitoes, and gnats are innumerable. Many species of birds summer in the region; caribou and polar bears are typical large mammals. Rodents and rabbits are also common.

                    <dt><h2>South America</h2></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        South America, fourth largest of the world’s continents. It is the southern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World, the Western Hemisphere, or simply the Americas. The continent is compact and roughly triangular in shape, being broad in the north and tapering to a point—Cape Horn, Chile—in the south.
                        <br/><br/>
                        South America is bounded by the Caribbean Sea to the northwest and north, the Atlantic Ocean to the northeast, east, and southeast, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. In the northwest it is joined to North America by the Isthmus of Panama, a land bridge narrowing to about 50 miles (80 km) at one point. Drake Passage, south of Cape Horn, separates South America from Antarctica.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Relatively few islands rim the continent, except in the south. These include the glaciated coastal archipelagoes of Argentina and Chile. The Falkland (Malvinas) Islands are east of southern Argentina. To the north, the West Indies stretch from Trinidad to Florida, but those islands usually are associated with North America. Of the remainder, most are small oceanic islands off the coasts of South America, including the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, in the Pacific Ocean.
                        <br/><br/>
                        South America has a total area of about 6,878,000 square miles (17,814,000 square km), or roughly one-eighth of the land surface of Earth. Its greatest north-south extent is about 4,700 miles, from Point Gallinas, Colombia, to Cape Horn, while its greatest east-west extent is some 3,300 miles, from Cape Branco, Brazil, to Point Pariñas, Peru. At 22,831 feet (6,959 metres) above sea level, Mount Aconcagua, in Argentina, near the border with Chile, is not only the continent’s highest point but also the highest elevation in the Western Hemisphere. The Valdés Peninsula, on the southeastern coast of Argentina, includes the lowest point, at 131 feet (40 metres) below sea level. In relation to its area, the continent’s coastline—some 15,800 miles in length—is exceptionally short.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The name America is derived from that of the Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci, one of the earliest European explorers of the New World. The term America originally was applied only to South America, but the designation soon was applied to the entire landmass. Because Mexico and Central America share an Iberian heritage with nearly all of South America, this entire region frequently is grouped under the name Latin America.
                        <br/><br/>
                        South America’s geologic structure consists of two dissymmetric parts. In the larger, eastern portion are found a number of stable shields forming highland regions, separated by large basins (including the vast Amazon basin). The western portion is occupied almost entirely by the Andes Mountains. The Andes—formed as the South American Plate drifted westward and forced the oceanic plate to the west under it—constitute a gigantic backbone along the entire Pacific coast of the continent. The basins east of the Andes and between the eastern highlands have been filled with large quantities of sediment washed down by the continent’s great rivers and their tributaries.
                        <br/><br/>
                        No other continent—except Antarctica—penetrates so far to the south. Although the northern part of South America extends north of the Equator and four-fifths of its landmass is located within the tropics, it also reaches subantarctic latitudes. Much of the high Andes lie within the tropics but include extensive zones of temperate or cold climate in the vicinity of the Equator—a circumstance that is unique. The great range in elevation produces an unrivaled diversity of climatic and ecological zones, which is probably the most prominent characteristic of South American geography.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The original inhabitants of South America are believed to have descended from the same Asiatic peoples who migrated to North America from Siberia during the most recent (Wisconsin) ice age. Few of these peoples, however, survived the arrival of Europeans after 1500, most succumbing to disease or mixing with people of European and (especially in Brazil) African origin. Some parts of the continent are now industrialized, with modern cities, but the people in rural areas still follow an agricultural way of life. The wealth of mineral products and renewable resources is considerable, yet economic development in most of the continent lags behind the more industrially advanced regions of the world. Nonetheless, concern has arisen about the rapidly increasing and often destructive exploitation of these resources.

                    <dt><h3>Climatic regions</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>  
                        South America can be divided into four major climatic regions—tropical, temperate, arid, and cold—their parameters determined by the elements described above.
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h4>Tropical climates</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Among the tropical climates, the tropical rainy, or rainforest, type occurs on the Pacific coast of Colombia, in the Amazon basin, on the coast of the Guianas, and on part of the coast of Brazil. The average daily temperature is about 86 °F (30 °C), with monthly and annual variations of less than about 5 °F (3 °C). Heavy rainfall, well-distributed throughout the year, averages about 100 inches (2,500 mm) annually in Belém (Brazil), about 110 inches (2,800 mm) in Iquitos (Peru), and 70 inches (1,800 mm) in Manaus (Brazil). The Chocó region of Colombia—one of the wettest areas in the world—receives in excess of 400 inches (10,200 mm), and it rains more than 300 days per year. In the Amazon region, rains do not fall evenly over the basin. The southern part receives most of its rainfall during the Southern Hemisphere summer (October to April), while the northern part has its rainy season during the Northern Hemisphere summer (May to September). The “dry” season is neither lengthy nor noticeable; humidity is always high.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The second type of tropical climate—the tropical wet-dry, or savanna (grassy parkland), type—is characterized by high temperatures (all monthly means above 64 °F, or 18 °C) but receives less precipitation and experiences a prolonged dry season. That type of climate is found on the fringes of the tropical-rainy belt, in the Orinoco basin, on the Brazilian Highlands, and in part of western Ecuador. Temperatures are still high and annual variations small, but daily temperature extremes are greater, typically ranging from a low of 65 °F (18 °C) to a high of 95 °F (35 °C).
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h4>Temperate climates</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        The temperate climates have a greater range of temperatures than the tropical climates and may include extreme climatic variations. Those climates, characterized by lower winter temperatures, are south of the Tropic of Capricorn (in Paraguay, parts of Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile) and in the mid-level elevations of the Andes. On the Atlantic side, temperatures in the warmest month average 77 °F (25 °C), but cold-month averages vary from 63 °F (17 °C) in the north (Asunción, Paraguay) to 50 °F (10 °C) in Buenos Aires. Rainfall exceeds 1.5 inches (40 mm) each month in the east but decreases to the west. In central Chile, between latitudes 32° and 38° S, the climatic features are similar to those of the lands adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, with mild winters and winter rains; summers, however, are cooler (69 °F, or 21 °C, in Santiago, Chile, in January—9 °F, or 5 °C, cooler than in Mediterranean locations). In southern Chile, winter temperatures are lower but not as low as the latitudes would indicate. The southern islands and channels have a relatively uniform cool climate throughout the year, and winters are much less severe than in Labrador (Canada), for example, which is at a comparable latitude and maritime location in the Northern Hemisphere. The presence of glaciers is the result of snowy winters and cool, cloudy summers during which ice does not completely melt. Rainfall is abundant—about 100 inches (2,500 mm) in Valdivia, Chile, and probably twice that figure on the western slopes of the mountains—and the southernmost west coast is one of the wettest regions in South America. A short distance inland, however, after passing into the lee of the Andes, rainfall decreases considerably (20 inches [500 mm] at Ushuaia, Argentina). Thus, in Patagonia an unusual situation exists in which those variations in rainfall result in more-significant differences in climate from west to east than from north to south.
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h4>Arid climates</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Warm and cold deserts and certain coastal and interior regions are classified as arid climates. Patagonia and northwestern Argentina constitute the largest of the interior arid regions. Rainfall is low, only about 4 inches (100 mm) in San Juan in the north and about 7 inches (180 mm) farther south in Neuquén. The annual range in average monthly temperatures in Patagonia—the greatest in South America—is more than 36 °F (20 °C), the result of warm summers and cold winters. The Atacama Desert, a narrow strip along the Pacific coast between latitudes 5° and 31° S, is a coastal desert. The cold seas associated with the Peru Current and the proximity of the high Andes produce an inversion of normal atmospheric temperatures, as air in contact with the water cools more rapidly than the upper strata of air. The result is a nearly continuous layer of stratus clouds about 1,200 feet (370 metres) thick, lying at elevations varying between about 1,000 and 3,000 feet (300 and 900 metres), that prevents air near the ground from being warmed. Temperatures, consequently, are relatively low: Lima has an average annual temperature of 64 °F (18 °C), ranging from about 72 °F (22 °C) in February to about 59 °F (15 °C) in August. The coast of Peru thus is the cloudiest—and one of the driest—deserts in the world, with no sunshine for at least six months of the year. It almost never rains, except under abnormal circumstances, but condensation of fog (called garúa by the Peruvians) provides a limited amount of moisture. A warm coastal desert extends from northeastern Colombia to Venezuela, covering a zone where rainfall is scarce and droughts are prolonged.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Finally, the belt that forms in northeastern Brazil, between the Parnaíba and São Francisco rivers, is classified as an interior warm arid zone. The interior highlands act as a wedge separating the sea winds from the northeast and those from the southeast, which carry their moisture beyond the region. Average annual rainfall is less than 4 inches (100 mm), and the dry season may last as long as seven months. The worst feature of the area’s climate is the irregularity of the rainfall, as a result of which severe droughts plague the region.
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h4>Cold climates</h4></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Areas where average annual temperatures are less than 50 °F (10 °C) are characterized as cold climates. Those occur in the southernmost parts of Argentina and Chile and in the high Andes above about 11,500 feet (3,500 metres). Mean temperatures are relatively low throughout the year, but daily variations are wide. There is a marked difference in humidity between the northern and southern parts of the upper Andean zone. In Colombia and Ecuador the climate at such elevations is cool and damp. Temperatures, always low, may on the average vary daily from 54 °F (12 °C) during the daytime to 28 °F (−2 °C) at night. Precipitation generally is high and well distributed throughout much of the year, although most of the Ecuadorian Andes have a dry period from June to August. Clouds and mist are dense in much of the region, and sunlight penetrates only for short periods. From central Peru to Bolivia and Chile, temperatures are still lower. Near Lake Titicaca, the average annual temperature is only about 34 to 36 °F (1 to 2 °C); November is the warmest month, with an average temperature of 41 °F (5 °C), while the coldest month, July, has an average of 28 °F (−2 °C). Daily variations are considerable; typically, a daytime maximum of 68 °F (20 °C) may drop to a nocturnal minimum of 5 °F (−15 °C). Annual rainfall varies from 24 to 56 inches (610 to 1,420 mm) but is concentrated during the southern summer. The dry season is long and is characteristically accompanied by drought. Winds are continuous and often violent, aggravating the coldness and the dryness of the climate, which produces a harsh environment. As in any mountainous region, climate varies largely according to local conditions.

                    <dt><h3>Relief</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        South America has two major mountain systems of contrasting nature. Bordering the Pacific Ocean to the west, the geologically young cordilleras of the Andes extend along the entire continent from north to south. Stretching along the continent’s northern and eastern sides are the ancient Guiana and Brazilian highlands, which are much lower in elevation and slope gently to the west; farther south are the plateaus of Patagonia. Lowlands—the basins of the Orinoco, Amazon, and Paraguay-Paraná rivers and the plains of the Pampas—separate the highlands from one another. Taken as a whole, the relief of the continent shows a great imbalance: the major drainage divide is far to the west along the crest of the Andes. Thus, rain that falls only 100 miles (160 km) east of the Pacific may flow to the Atlantic Ocean, 2,500 miles (4,000 km) away.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The ranges of the Andes Mountains, about 5,500 miles (8,900 km) long and second only to the Himalayas in average elevation, constitute a formidable and continuous barrier, with many summits exceeding 20,000 feet (6,100 metres). The Venezuelan Andes—the northernmost range of the system—run parallel to the Caribbean Sea coast in Venezuela west of Caracas, before turning to the southwest and entering Colombia. In Colombia the Andes—which trend generally to the north and south—form three distinct ranges: the Cordilleras Oriental, Central, and Occidental. The valley of the Magdalena River, between the Oriental and the Central ranges, and the valley of the Cauca River, between the Central and the Occidental ranges, are huge rift valleys formed by faulting rather than by erosion. An aerial view of the Andes in Colombia shows, within relatively short distances, a succession of hot lowlands interspersed with high ranges with snowcapped peaks.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In Ecuador the Andes form two parallel cordilleras, one facing the Pacific and the other descending abruptly eastward toward the Amazon basin, crowned by towering peaks. Between the ranges lies a series of high basins. Three cordilleras run through Peru and are known by Peruvians as the Eastern Cordillera; the Central, or Blanca (“White”), Cordillera, named for the glaciated summit of Mount Huascarán, the country’s highest peak, which rises to 22,025 feet (6,713 metres); and the Western, or Negra (“Black”), Cordillera, which has no snowcapped summits.
                        <br/><br/>
                        South of Lima, Peru, and extending through western Bolivia, the Andes branch into two distinct ranges. Between them lies the Altiplano, a vast complex of high plateaus between about 12,000 and 15,000 feet (3,700 and 4,600 metres) in elevation and as much as 125 miles (200 km) wide. The Altiplano forms a maze of depressions, hills, and vast plains without equivalent except in Tibet. Water accumulates in closed basins to form marshes and lakes, the largest of which is Lake Titicaca on the border of Peru and Bolivia. That central region of the Andes has been dissected by several rivers, all of which have cut spectacular gorges down the eastern slopes.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Farther to the south—along the border between Chile and Argentina—the Andes form a single but lofty chain with many of the system’s highest peaks, including Mount Aconcagua, which, at 22,831 feet (6,959 metres), is the highest point on the continent and in the Western Hemisphere; south of Aconcagua, elevations gradually diminish. In southern Chile part of the cordillera descends beneath the sea, forming innumerable islands with steep slopes. The Andes have been deeply carved by glaciers, particularly in the south. Ice masses still occupy some 1,900 square miles (4,900 square km), constituting a huge ice cap with long terminal tongues running into piedmont lakes or into the sea.The Andes are studded with numerous volcanoes that are part of the Circum-Pacific volcanic chain, often called the Ring of Fire. Earthquakes are frequent. Almost every major city has been devastated at least once by earthquake, even along the coastal plains, where clear signs of recent vertical movement are visible.
                        <br/><br/>
                        To the north and east, the Guiana and Brazilian highlands consist of ancient crystalline rocks greatly worn through prolonged erosion. The Guiana Highlands are mostly below elevations of 1,000 feet (300 metres), with small rises separated by marshy depressions. Occasional dome-shaped granitic inselbergs (steep-sided residual hills)—some 2,000 feet (600 metres) in elevation—surmount the landscape. The southern edge rises abruptly to a series of mountain chains and high tablelands (tepuis), in which the highest summit is Mount Roraima (9,094 feet [2,772 metres]).
                        <br/><br/>
                        Covering an area of about 580,000 square miles (1,500,000 square km), the Brazilian Highlands (also called the Brazilian Plateau) rise to an average elevation of about 3,000 feet (900 metres) and are crowned by numerous sierras (ranges). Included in that region is Bandeira Peak (9,482 feet [2,890 metres]), one of the highest points in Brazil. The São Francisco River, draining a large basin to the east, has cut deeply into the highlands. In the north the highlands slope gently to the sea, but in the east they drop abruptly, as much as 2,600 feet (800 metres) within a few miles. Skirting their southern edge, the Serra do Mar has summits of more than 7,000 feet (2,100 metres) in elevation. The sea has partly invaded the lower sections of the original coastal ranges and formed Guanabara Bay, which includes the harbour of Rio de Janeiro. Nearby are such steep-sided rocky peaks as Sugar Loaf (Portuguese: Pão de Açucar; 1,296 feet [395 metres]) and Mount Corcovado (2,310 feet [704 metres]), which rise dramatically from the sea.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the far south, Patagonia constitutes a series of vast tablelands that rise, terracelike, from the Atlantic to the Andes and are covered with rounded pebbles and crumbling sandstones. Geologically recent volcanic eruptions have spread sheets of basaltic lava over large parts of southern Patagonia and have dotted the sedimentary plateaus with volcanic cones.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The Orinoco River basin is nearly coextensive with the Llanos. It lies between the Venezuelan Andes and the Guiana Highlands and is covered with alluvia brought down by the Andean torrents.
                        The Amazonian depression, the largest river basin in the world, forms an enormous region, bounded by the Andes to the west, the Guiana Highlands to the north, and the Brazilian Highlands to the south. The ancient platform of Precambrian rock underlying the depression is covered with deep layers of alluvial sand and clay, so that it forms an immense plain of low undulations, the general eastward incline being extremely slight. The river port of Iquitos, Peru, which is about 2,500 miles (4,000 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, is at an elevation of only 384 feet (117 metres), while Manaus, Brazil, far downstream in the heart of the basin, has an elevation of 144 feet (44 metres).
                        <br/><br/>
                        The basin of the Paraguay River, between the Bolivian Andes in the west and the Brazilian Highlands in the east, consists of a series of alluvial plains drained by a complex network of rivers interspersed with marshes. To the east, the marshes are called the Pantanal. They are only a few hundred feet above sea level. Annual flooding during the rainy season (about November through March) causes an immense swamp to form. The extensive plains west of the river, called the Gran Chaco, generally are arid.

                        The Pampas of Argentina, covering almost 300,000 square miles (777,000 square km), consist of a thick accumulation of loose sediments brought down from the Andes. Those deposits, some 1,000 feet (300 metres) deep at Buenos Aires and even deeper in other places, have completely buried the ancient features of the land. The landscape seems perfectly level, although it actually rises imperceptibly toward the west—from near sea level at Buenos Aires to 2,320 feet (707 metres) at Mendoza. Some ranges, such as Córdoba and San Luis, are conspicuous features on the otherwise flat plains.

                        South America possesses a distinctive plant life. The biotic region is called the Neotropics, and its faunal realm the Neogaean. The region extends southward from the Tropic of Cancer and includes Central and South America—even the temperate southern portion. There are some similarities between South America’s vegetation and that of other continents, as a result of past geologic developments. The pattern of distribution within the continent is complex because of the variety of climatic and ecological zones. The northern tropical regions are the richest in diversity, while the southern regions and the western Andean highlands are much impoverished, despite some differentiation.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The proportion of endemic plants in South America is very high, even at the family level. Among angiosperms (plants having seeds enclosed in an ovary) no fewer than 25 families and 3,500 genera are endemic to the tropical and temperate zones. Others are related to African plants or belong to southern plant groups also distributed in southern Africa and in Australasia. Vegetation is by no means uniform throughout the continent; its distribution is determined by climatic, geographic, soil, and sometimes anthropic (human-related) differences.

                        Grasslands are abundant in the South American lowlands. They can be classified as tropical, as with savannas, or subtropical, as with the Argentine Pampas.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Tropical savannas are found mostly in the Llanos of Venezuela and northeastern Colombia. Those vast plains are covered with grasses and sedges, but tree clusters (mainly palms) also grow, especially along streams.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The flat or softly rolling plains called Pampas, which constitute the greater part of eastern Argentina, are covered with grasses. It is believed that the Pampas were originally covered with trees but that the trees were removed by humans. Others think that the plains were always covered with grassy vegetation, citing the existence of the ombu, a scrubby treelike plant that is part of the grass family, as an example. Exotic pines, eucalypti, oaks, and poplars constitute introduced trees. To the south the Pampas merge with the Patagonian steppe, where tussock grasses are mixed with scattered low bushes and spiny plants.

                    <dt><h3>Tropical and subtropical rainforests</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd> 
                        Rainforest covers the largest part of the Amazon region, most of the Guianas, southern and eastern Venezuela, the Atlantic slopes of the Brazilian Highlands, and the Pacific coast of Colombia and northern Ecuador. The Amazon region is the largest and probably the oldest forest area in the world; it also ascends the slopes of the Andes until it merges with subtropical and temperate regions. On its southern border it mixes with the woodlands of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, with galleries of trees extending along the rivers. Consisting of enormous trees, some exceeding a height of 300 feet (90 metres), the rainforest is composed of an almost incredible number of species growing side by side in the greatest profusion and arranged in different strata. There are about 2,500 species of Amazonian trees. In the region of Manaus, Brazil, for example, 1,652 plants belonging to 107 species in 37 different families were found on about 1,900 square feet (180 square metres).
                        <br/><br/>
                        The forests of the swamps (igapós), where the ground is inundated or very marshy throughout the year, cover the lowlands. Characteristic trees are, among others, jacareúbas (Calophyllum brasiliense), which is a tall tree with hard reddish brown wood used for heavy construction, araparis (Macrolobium acaciaefolium), abiuranas (Lucuma species), piranheiras (Piranhea trifoliata), and louros-do-igapo (Nectandra amazonum). Undergrowth is dense.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the annually flooded plains known as várzeas, trees are higher and quite diversified; they include oeiranas (Alchornea castaneifolia), a euphorbia (i.e., characterized by a milky juice), and the trumpet tree (Cecropia peltata), a rapid-growing tree of the mulberry family with a light wood. Palms and hevea (wild rubber plants) grow in those forests. The forests of the nonswampy areas are rich in hardwoods, of which acapu (a tree with dark brown wood), pau-amarelo (Euxylophora paraensis), pau-santo (Zollernia paraensis), massaranduba (a Brazilian tree with light reddish brown wood), jarana (a tree with hard, heavy, durable wood), and matamata (a tree with hard, heavy, durable wood, used for pilings) are the best known. Hevea and the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) are characteristic of those forests where spiny palms cover the ground.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Epiphytes (nonparasitic plants that grow on other plants, deriving moisture and nutrients from rain and air) are numerous, mostly Bromeliaceae (a family having spiny leaves), orchids, and ferns. Lianas abound, particularly in drier forests.
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h3>Tropical deciduous forests</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Those forests, dominated by trees of moderate height, notably of leguminous species, are found widely throughout northern South America, where the climate is characterized by a prolonged dry season, notably in Venezuela, Colombia, and the Brazilian Highlands.
                    </dd><br/>

                    <dt><h3>Mountain vegetation</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        In the high Andes, a temperate zone extends from the upper limit of the subtropical rainforest (about 6,000 feet [1,800 metres]) up to the lower limit of the Andean meadows, at an elevation of about 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) in Ecuador and Peru. That zone is very humid on the Amazonian side because of rising air, where both the epiphytes and the undergrowth are dense, creating a cloud forest.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The upper zones have a peculiar vegetation that touches the snow line. In the wet northern Andes in Colombia and Ecuador, Alpine meadows called páramo consist of grasses and other herbaceous plants, often with bright flowers; those are surmounted by taller plants, especially the showy frailejones (Espeletia), which grow 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 metres) high and are crowned by large bouquets of long hairy leaves.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the south, páramo vegetation merges with that of the high plateaus, notably the tola, a tough wind-resistant shrub, in the Altiplano of southeastern Peru and western Bolivia. Typical vegetation consists of rough grasses, between which grow a variety of herbaceous, cushion, and rosette plants, shrubs, and cacti. Vegetation extends to the limit of permanent snow but becomes scarce at higher elevations, where soil is often barren.

                    <dd>
                        South American animal life is particularly rich and well diversified as a result of the wide range of habitats. Moreover, because of its isolation from the rest of the world during Paleogene and Neogene times (about 66 to 2.6 million years ago), the South American landmass is characterized by considerable biological originality. Many animals belong to exclusive groups, and even at the family level the percentage of endemic forms is high. Speciation has reached a higher degree in South America than in other parts of the world. Nonetheless, there are some similarities between South America’s fauna and that of other continents as a result of past geologic developments. Ancient groups of animals including mollusks, chilopods, some fishes, reptiles, and amphibians show affinities with the animal life of Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. More recent species, mostly vertebrates, migrated from North America. Animals such as armadillos, anteaters, porcupines, and opossums migrated in both directions.

                    <dt><h3>Fish and bird life</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Freshwater fishes are numerous, with about 2,700 species, though they derive from only a few ancestral groups. Amazonian fishes may approach 1,500 species in number. Among the dominant groups are characins (800 species), which include the flesh-eating piranha; gymnotids, South American cyprinoid fishes that include the electric eel; catfishes; cyprinodonts, a large family of small scaly-headed soft-finned fishes; and cichlids, a family consisting chiefly of fishes that somewhat resemble sunfish.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Birds are represented by 89 families and some 3,000 species—a much higher figure than in Africa or Asia, which justifies the application of the name bird continent to South America. Some 25 families are endemic to the Neotropical region. Unique birds include rheas (large, tall, flightless birds that resemble ostriches), curassows (large arboreal birds distantly related to the domestic fowl), hoatzins (a brownish crested bird, having claws on the digits of the wing when young), oilbirds, motmots (bright-coloured birds related to kingfishers), jacamars (small, bright-coloured birds), toucans, manakins, and cotingas (related to manakins), and many passerine (perching) birds. Hummingbirds have evolved to fill a variety of habitat niches, with more than 120 species in Ecuador alone. Parrots, pigeons, cuckoos, tyrants (a kind of flycatcher), woodhewers, and orioles are among the dominant groups. Remarkably, the proportion of nonpasserine to passerine birds is greater in South America than in any other part of the world. Several species of penguins are native to southern South America, the coastal regions of Peru and Chile, and the Galapagos Islands.

                        The range of mammals includes those that existed on the continent before its complete isolation, such as marsupials (pouched animals) and sloths, those that migrated to the continent, and those that migrated to and from South America. Smaller mammals such as monkeys and rodents were among the first to migrate to South America. Later, tapirs, deer, bears, rabbits, and many others arrived, as did the camel family, which gave rise to vicuñas, guanacos, alpacas, and llamas some 6,000 years ago.

                    <dt><h3>Amphibians and reptiles</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd> 
                        Amphibians are well represented by caecilians (small wormlike, burrowing amphibians), salamanders, toads, and a number of varieties of frogs, including clawed frogs, the most aquatic of all. The tree frogs, arboreal amphibians, are particularly abundant through the Amazon basin and are very different from their African and Asian counterparts, although the frog faunas of Australia and South America often are strikingly alike. Reptiles include a great variety of turtles and tortoises, crocodiles, caimans (endemic crocodilians), geckos, many iguanas, teiids (a family of mostly tropical American lizards), Amphisbaena (a genus of harmless, limbless lizards), and many snakes, including boas, anacondas, colubrids (a very large family of nonvenomous snakes), coral snakes, and vipers.

Thousands of species, especially insects of the tropical rainforest, have yet to be classified. South America has the richest array of butterflies of any continent, including the spectacularly coloured members of the Morphidae subfamily; the social insects—termites, ants, wasps, and bees—also are well represented. Many of the best-known arthropods (e.g., mosquitoes, sand flies, and kissing bugs) are responsible for the transmission of human diseases such as dengue and malaria.

                    <dt><h2>Australia</h2></dt><br/>
                    <dd>
                        Australia, the smallest continent and one of the largest countries on Earth, lying between the Pacific and Indian oceans in the Southern Hemisphere. Australia’s capital is Canberra, located in the southeast between the larger and more important economic and cultural centres of Sydney and Melbourne.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The Australian mainland extends from west to east for nearly 2,500 miles (4,000 km) and from Cape York Peninsula in the northeast to Wilsons Promontory in the southeast for nearly 2,000 miles (3,200 km). To the south, Australian jurisdiction extends a further 310 miles (500 km) to the southern extremity of the island of Tasmania, and in the north it extends to the southern shores of Papua New Guinea. Australia is separated from Indonesia to the northwest by the Timor and Arafura seas, from Papua New Guinea to the northeast by the Coral Sea and the Torres Strait, from the Coral Sea Islands Territory by the Great Barrier Reef, from New Zealand to the southeast by the Tasman Sea, and from Antarctica in the far south by the Indian Ocean.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Australia has been called “the Oldest Continent,” “the Last of Lands,” and “the Last Frontier.” Those descriptions typify the world’s fascination with Australia, but they are somewhat unsatisfactory. In simple physical terms, the age of much of the continent is certainly impressive—most of the rocks providing the foundation of Australian landforms were formed during Precambrian and Paleozoic time (some 4.6 billion to 252 million years ago)—but the ages of the cores of all the continents are approximately the same. On the other hand, whereas the landscape history of extensive areas in Europe and North America has been profoundly influenced by events and processes that occurred since late in the last Ice Age—roughly the past 25,000 years—in Australia scientists use a more extensive timescale that takes into account the great antiquity of the continent’s landscape.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The most striking characteristics of the vast country are its global isolation, its low relief, and the aridity of much of its surface. If, like the English novelist D.H. Lawrence, visitors from the Northern Hemisphere are at first overwhelmed by “the vast, uninhabited land and by the grey charred bush…so phantom-like, so ghostly, with its tall, pale trees and many dead trees, like corpses,” they should remember that to Australians the bush—that sparsely populated Inland or Outback beyond the Great Dividing Range of mountains running along the Pacific coast and separating it from the cities in the east—is familiar and evokes nostalgia. It still retains some of the mystical quality it had for the first explorers searching for inland seas and great rivers, and it remains a symbol of Australia’s strength and independence; the Outback poem by A.B. (“Banjo”) Paterson, “Waltzing Matilda,” is the unofficial national anthem of Australia known the world over.

                    <dt><h3>Climate</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>  
                        Australia is the arid continent. Over some two-thirds of its landmass, precipitation (largely as rainfall) per annum averages less than 20 inches (500 mm), and over one-third of it is less than 10 inches (250 mm). Little more than one-tenth of the continent receives more than 40 inches (1,000 mm) per year. As has been noted, in winter the snowfields of Tasmania and the Mount Kosciuszko area can be extensive, but on the whole Australia is an extremely hot country, in consequence of which evaporation losses are high and the effectiveness of the rainfall received is reduced. In addition, the severity of climate, the predominance of the outdoors in the minds and lives of many, and the national importance of agricultural and pastoral pursuits all make Australians perhaps more climate-conscious than most. In no country of comparable development do climate and weather loom so large in the lives and conversation of the people.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The principal features of Australia’s climate stem from its position, shape, and size. Australia is mainly a compact tropical and near-tropical continent. No major arms or embayments of the sea penetrate far into the landmass. The only extensive uplands occur near the east coast, and even they are not, by world standards, very high.
                        <br><br>
                        In summer (December–February), when the sun is directly overhead in northern Australia, temperatures are extremely high. The sea exerts little moderating influence, and the uplands are not sufficiently extensive or high to have more than local effects. Temperatures commonly soar above the 100 °F (38 °C) mark in the interior, but because there rarely is any cloud cover, radiation loss is considerable at night, and daily temperature ranges are wide. High temperatures dominate the Australian summers in all but Tasmania. Heat waves are common, and, though the highest amounts of solar radiation are received in northern South Australia, the highest temperatures and longest heat waves are recorded in the northwest of Western Australia. For example, Marble Bar has recorded a maximum temperature of 100 °F or more on 162 consecutive days. Temperatures in winter remain moderate except in the uplands of Tasmania and southeastern Australia, where snow is common. Night frosts are common in winter throughout southern Australia and in the interior.
                        <br><br>
                        Because of its relatively low latitudinal position, Australia comes under the influence of the southeast trade winds in the north and the westerlies in the south. Northern Australia is affected by a northerly monsoon, partly because of the latitude and the seasonal migration of planetary wind zones and partly because of the summer heating of the continental interior that draws in surface winds. The monsoon brings summer (December–February) rains to the northern coastal area that penetrate inland for variable distances. The summer rains are all the more important because most of northern Australia is in the sheltered rain shadow of the Eastern Uplands, which block the rain-bearing southeast trades in winter. The trades, forced to rise by the uplands, bring heavy rains to the Pacific coasts of Queensland and northern New South Wales. Those areas are also affected by tropical cyclones and receive the heaviest rains of any part of Australia. Within the coastal fringe, the northern Queensland area around Tully, south of Cairns, is the wettest, with an annual average of nearly 160 inches (4,050 mm).
                        <br><br>
                        Southern Australia receives winter rains from depressions associated with the west-wind zone. Again, there are local topographic controls, with uplands receiving higher amounts than the adjacent plains. Parts of the southern Mount Lofty Range, in South Australia, average more than 40 inches (1,000 mm) of rainfall per year, but Adelaide, to the west, averages only about 20 inches (500 mm), while the Murray plains, in the rain shadows of the range, receive 15 inches (380 mm) or less rainfall annually.
                        <br><br>
                        In the great mass of the interior of Australia, annual rainfall averages less than 20 inches (500 mm), and over vast areas the total is less than 10 inches (250 mm); the Lake Eyre region averages less than half that amount. Rainfall in those areas is unreliable and capricious, with long droughts broken by damaging rains and floods. Over Australia as a whole, rainfall is indeed extremely variable. Only in the far north, around Darwin, in the southwest of Western Australia, in southern South Australia and Victoria, in Tasmania, and in eastern New South Wales is the recorded annual precipitation fairly consistent, in any given year totaling no more than 10 percent above or below the long-term average in specific years.
                        <br><br>
                        Much of Australia’s marked climatic variability has been ascribed to the changeability in differential air pressures over the central Pacific and the Indonesian archipelago, primarily caused by contrasts in sea and ocean temperatures. The resulting large-scale swing in air pressure is known as the Southern Oscillation. Monitoring the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is now considered essential to seasonal weather forecasting. The SOI is strongly negative when weak Pacific winds bring less moisture than usual to Australia. Prolonged negative phases are related to El Niño episodes in the South Pacific, and most of Australia’s major droughts have been related to those episodes. Prolonged positive SOI phases (during La Niña) normally bring above-average rainfall and floods to eastern and northern Australia. In each case, however, the correlations are not exact.
                        <br><br>
                        The Australian climate is also influenced by the phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which refers to the year to year temperature differences between the eastern and western portions of that body of water. The IOD alternates between three phases—positive, negative, and neutral—each of which generally occurs every three to five years. During the neutral phase, the IOD has little influence on the Australian climate. The increased westerly winds that arise during the negative phase cause warmer water to concentrate northwest of Australia, ultimately producing above-average rainfall in parts of southern Australia. On the other hand, during the positive phase, westerly winds weaken, permitting warmer water to move toward Africa, lessening cloud creation over Australia and reducing rainfall in much of western, southern, and eastern Australia.
                        <br><br>
                        The hot, dry weather that is typical for Australia in the summer (December–February) often produces bushfires. In 1939, 71 people we killed in the “Black Friday” blaze in Victoria, and 75 individuals perished in the “Ash Wednesday” fires in Victoria and South Australia in 1983. The scale of the 2009 fires—attributed to extreme weather conditions coupled with a severe and protracted drought that had created tinder-dry vegetation across the state—was unprecedented. The deaths of 173 people that resulted from these “Black Saturday” bushfires left the country in a state of shock.

                    <dd>
                        Australian federal and state government agencies and some universities maintain facilities for the scientific collection, storage, and study of Australian plants. Updated knowledge about those plants comes mainly from such institutions and reaches the public through published handbooks, called floras, listing and illustrating the species. The number of general popular books dealing with the ornamental, horticultural, medicinal, culinary, and other uses of plants increased sharply following the publication of a major new flora, the multivolume series Flora of Australia (1981– ).
                        <br><br>
                        Australia’s phanerogamian (seed plant) flora of approximately 20,000 species is thought to have arisen in ancient times from two distinct intakes of stock. Both stocks had previously been involved in a wider theatre, and each intake was followed by a period when the species adapted and diversified within the continent. The great advances in geophysics toward understanding continental drift have made it possible to take the paleontological and related botanical evidence and reconstruct the physical environment and time-sequence.
                        <br><br>
                        Australia’s initial intake of flora originated—as was the case with present-day South America, Africa, India, Madagascar, New Caledonia, New Zealand, and Antarctica—during the period when it was part of Gondwana. Hence, much Gondwanan flora is still shared among the now-separated lands, both at present and in the fossil record, including, for example, the southern beech (also called the Antarctic, or myrtle, beech), the conifer families Podocarpaceae and Araucariaceae, and many angiosperm families (e.g., Myrtaceae, Proteaceae, and Stylidiaceae).
                        <br><br>
                        Australia also shares many groups of plants with the Malesian region (the Malay Archipelago) to the north. That is considered to be the result of a second, two-way exchange much later in geologic history, in the Miocene Epoch, when continental drift eventually brought Australia into close proximity with the Malesian region. Thus, typically Australian taxa such as the genus Leptospermum (of the family Myrtaceae) extend northward; Baeckea extends to China, Melaleuca to India, and Eucalyptus to the Philippines. Of the family Epacridaceae, Leucopogon extends to Malaysia and Thailand, and Trochocarpa to Borneo and Celebes (Sulawesi). Conversely, more than 200 genera of plants best known from the Malesian region or northward are represented in Australia (mainly northern Australia), each by a single species not confined to Australia. Those are comparatively recent arrivals from the north.
                        <br><br>
                        The characteristic part of Australia’s plant life that is little shared with other lands, together with those specialized characteristics that apparently originated on the continent long ago, form what has been designated as an Australian (or autochthonous) element. It includes many of the plants that are distinctive to typical Australian vegetation scenery and shows a marked tendency to sclerophylly (formation of hard leaves). Speculation has linked sclerophylly with low soil nutrient levels. Australia ranks lowest among the continents for soil fertility. Many genera include various species, each adapted to different environments across the entire range of the continent’s habitats.
                        <br><br>
                        The Australian element includes derivatives of Gondwanan stock channeled specially to Australia, at the family level (for example, Epacridaceae, Myoporaceae, Goodeniaceae, and Stackhousiaceae), together with typically Australian developments within nonendemic families—for example, subfamily Leptospermoideae of Myrtaceae, the genera Banksia and Hakea of Proteaceae, the grass trees and blackboys (family Xanthorrhoeaceae, separated from Liliaceae), and the kangaroo paws (family Haemodoraceae).
                        <br><br>
                        Most obvious to the visitor is Eucalyptus, which is represented by more than 400 species, ranging in size from diminutive mallees, smaller than a person, to forest giants matching in bulk and height the world’s largest plants. Their habitat is similarly varied, ranging from rainforest to snowfield to hot desert fringe. Members of the genus Acacia have undergone similar adaptive diversification; the 700 species range from mulga and myall—the dominant trees of vast arid areas—to small leafless blades at ground level, the grass wattles.

                        The word vegetation, as opposed to plant life, implies the structure and communal relations of the landscape’s plant cover, whether it be forest, grassland, or marsh. There is no standard, or worldwide, classification system (such as exists for describing flora) for that aspect of the environment. Initial attempts to apply European and American classification concepts to Australia were not particularly satisfactory, because of the peculiarities of the continent’s vegetation and environment. For example, climatic control of local vegetation zones was often found insufficient to explain vegetation changes; on the contrary, soil patterns and geologic history quite override climatic control in many localities. Similarly, structural descriptive schemes useful for Northern Hemisphere coniferous and deciduous vegetation proved inappropriate when confronted by the great variety of evergreen vegetation—notably mallees and shrubs—found in Australia. The mapping of Australian vegetation is based largely on factual descriptive features, and by that means comprehensive and detailed accounts and maps have been produced.
                        <br><br>
                        Australian plant life is distributed in three main zones—the Tropical, Temperate, and Eremian—a pattern that reflects overall climatic conditions. The Tropical Zone, which arcs east and west across the northern margin of the continent and extends halfway down the eastern seaboard, has a mainly dry monsoonal climate, with some wet regions. The Temperate Zone, with a cool-to-warm (temperate-to-subtropical) climate and precipitation mostly in winter, is arced across the southern margin, embracing Tasmania and extending up the eastern seaboard to overlap slightly with the Tropical Zone. The Eremian Zone covers the whole of central Australia through to the west-central coast; its climate is arid.
                        <br><br>
                        The major structural units constituting the geographic distribution are rainforest, sclerophyll forest (dominated by hard-leaved plants such as eucalypts), and woodland, scrub, savanna, and grassland forms, each with a range of subforms. The bulk of the Tropical Zone comprises mixed deciduous woodland and sclerophyllous low-tree savanna, with areas of tussock grassland, coastal mangrove complexes, and tropical rainforest containing much exotic vegetation—particularly in the northeastern parts of Cape York Peninsula and in Queensland. A strong Malesian influence occurs throughout the entire zone. The rainforests—characterized by large trees with stem buttresses and by multiple vegetation layers with interlaced canopies of lianas and epiphytes growing in the trees—fit the popular concept of “jungle.”
                        <br><br>
                        The Temperate Zone is characterized by dry and wet sclerophyllous forests, temperate mixed woodlands, savanna woodlands, mallees, and scrubs, with areas of alpine vegetational complexes, temperate rainforest, and sclerophyllous heath. A much higher proportion of the vegetation cover is typically and recognizably “Australian.” Within that zone the southwestern corner of Western Australia is outstanding, both for the high proportion of Australian plants and for the richness of the plant life, while the vegetation of Tasmania is notable for its forests of southern beech and for its botanical links with New Zealand and South America. In marked contrast to the tropical rainforests, the predominant trees throughout most of the Temperate Zone communities are either Eucalyptus or Acacia. Much of the Temperate Zone vegetation has been cleared for agricultural purposes, leaving only the vegetation communities of infertile or inaccessible localities.
                        <br><br>
                        The vegetation of the Eremian Zone ranges from barely vegetated desert and hills through a variety of semiarid shrub savannas, shrub steppes, semiarid tussock grasslands, and sclerophyllous hummock grasslands. Many shrubs have adapted themselves similarly to the arid conditions, so that in their vegetative state many representatives of different families look alike. Acacia, Eremophila, and Casuarina are examples of genera that tend to displace Eucalyptus as the dominant tree or shrub. Much of that vegetation is badly degraded.

                    <dd>
                        The distribution of climates, topography, and soils that has produced the zones and ecological variation of Australian vegetation has also been reflected in the distribution of animal life. Australia probably has between 200,000 and 300,000 species, about 100,000 of which have been described. There are some 250 species of native mammals, 550 species of land and aquatic birds, 680 species of reptiles, 190 species of frogs, and more than 2,000 species of marine and freshwater fish. The remainder are invertebrates, including insects.
                        <br><br>
                        In the varied environments of the Tropical Zone, species confined to the rainforests of the mountainous northeast include the tree kangaroos (genus Dendrolagus) and the gorgeous bird-wing butterflies (Ornithoptera). Others favour more open habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Among that group are the agile wallaby (Macropus agilis) and Amitermes meridionalis, a termite that orients its mounds in a north-south direction by sensing Earth’s magnetic field.
                        <br><br>
                        The animals of the Eremian Zone are characterized by their ability to survive under extremely arid conditions and irregular rainfall. Examples include the marsupial mole (Notoryctes typhlops), a burrower in sand, and the water-holding frog of the genus Cyclorana. After rainy spells Cyclorana burrows deep in the soil, forming a chamber in which it lies in a cocoonlike sac filled with water formed from a special outer layer of its skin. The budgerigar (Melopsittacus) is adapted to irregular rainfall by being nomadic.
                        <br><br>
                        The fauna of the eucalyptus forests and other habitats of the Temperate Zone contains animals whose life cycles rely on regular winter rainfall. Many are highly adapted to the eucalyptus forests. The koala depends on the foliage of just a few species of forest eucalyptus. Lyrebirds and gray kangaroos are forest dwellers. Gray kangaroos also range into semiarid shrublands and heaths. The only Australian alpine animals occur in the high mountains of the Temperate Zone. They include the mountain pygmy possum (genus Burramys) and the alpine grasshopper (Kosciuscola).Some species occur in all zones. They include the galah (Cacatua roseicapilla; a species of cockatoo) and the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen).
                        <br><br>
                        Extinction of native species is a matter of much concern. Some 20 mammal, 20 bird, and 70 flowering plant species are presumed to have become extinct during the period of European settlement. Some 50 terrestrial mammals and more than 1,000 flowering plants are officially listed as both endangered or vulnerable; that description is also applied to about 30 amphibians, 50 reptiles, and 50 birds. Estimates of the numbers of introduced species include 1,500 to 2,000 flowering plants, 30 freshwater and marine fish, and about 70 land animals and birds. There has also been a great reduction of range of most species inhabiting temperate or semiarid lands, except for those that have benefited from the extension of pastures and watering points. The latter species include the large kangaroos and the Australian magpie.
                        <br><br>
                        The high degree to which many species depend on a relatively narrow range of vegetation types means that animals of some zones have suffered more from human activity than others. Small and medium-size terrestrial mammals and ground-nesting birds of temperate and semiarid grasslands and shrublands have been most affected by clearing for pastures and cereal crops. In addition, they have suffered most from competition with and habitat destruction by introduced animals such as rabbits, sheep, goats, and cattle and from predation by the foxes and feral cats. Few parts of Australia are free from the effects of introduced animal species. In the tropical north the cane toad (Bufo marinus) is believed to be a major predator of small native vertebrates. Even the introduced honeybee, which is widely established in the feral state, is suspected of affecting native nectar-feeding insects, mammals, and birds.
                        <br><br>
                        The role of Aboriginal people in causing the extinction of fauna before European settlement has been much debated. It is clear that at the time of European settlement Aboriginal hunting and burning had major effects on animal numbers, but a balance seems to have been maintained, possibly assisted by a system of social prohibitions that protected important species under certain conditions. But the effect of the initial Aboriginal entry on the continent is not yet clear. At that time, at least 60,000 years ago, the fauna contained many species of large animals (the Australian megafauna) and was considerably different from the fauna present at the time of European settlement. Such megafaunal animals as the rhinoceros-sized Diprotodon, giant wombats, the giant short-faced kangaroos (Sthenurus and Procoptodon), the so-called marsupial lion Thylacoleo, and giant flightless birds called mihirungs or Genyornis probably became extinct over a period between 27,000 and 12,000 years ago, possibly as late as 6,000 years ago.
                        <br><br>
                        It has been argued that Aboriginal overhunting, together with environmental changes caused by associated Aboriginal burning of the country, caused the extinction of those species. Others have suggested that climatic fluctuations at the end of the Pleistocene (some 11,700 years ago) were a more likely cause. Certainly, although there were no extensive ice sheets in Australia, the last glacial maximum (between 22,000 and 18,000 years ago) was a time of highly arid, as well as cold and windy, conditions. Deserts reached their greatest extent at that time, and there is no doubt that under such conditions the fauna (as well as humans) would have been under considerable physiological stress. No clear consensus has emerged, and, in view of the facts that there is no evidence of a sudden mass extinction and that Aboriginal people seem to have occupied most of Australia for at least 20,000 years before the last megafauna disappeared, it is likely that a combination of all those factors played a part. By about 20,000 years ago, few mammals had survived that weighed more than their human predators.
                        <br><br>
                        Commercial hunting of only a few species of native fauna is allowed. It is confined to several species of the kangaroo family, muttonbirds (Puffinus tenuirostris), and some of the most common cockatoos and parrots; however, federal law does not permit live birds to be exported. Permits can be obtained to destroy pest species (such as kangaroos in certain circumstances). Sport shooting of game birds (ducks, quail, and snipes) and a few mammals is permitted in some states. Before controls were established, the numbers of several attractive varieties of parrots and cockatoos—as well as of crocodiles and such mammals as koalas, brushtail possums, ringtail possums, many wallaby species, and seals—reduced dramatically. Most have recovered, however. Quotas are set for the commercial taking of kangaroos each year for hides and for human and pet food. Numbers of kangaroos are constantly monitored, and there is no evidence of any reduction in the wild populations. Hundreds of thousands of muttonbirds are taken yearly for human consumption.
                        <br><br>
                        Fauna authorities and scientists responsible for conserving kangaroos support such commercial exploitation on scientific grounds. Many also believe that it would be in the interest of both conservation and agricultural practice to encourage husbandry of kangaroos. However, many others, both in Australia and elsewhere, are vehemently opposed to killing kangaroos for any reason. The issue has become highly political.
                        <br><br>
                        Australia has its share of potentially dangerous, as well as commercially useful, animals. The large saltwater crocodile (Crocodilus porosus) is known to eat humans. Of the many poisonous elapid snakes, the most dangerous to humans include taipans (Oxyuranus), smooth snakes (Parademansia), tiger snakes (Notechis), brown snakes (Pseudonaja), and death adders (Acanthophis); the latter, although smaller than the others, have large fangs, a lightning-fast strike, and highly toxic venom. About one-seventh of Australia’s snake species pose a deadly threat to humans. There are many poisonous spiders, the best-known being the funnel-web spider (Atrax) and the red-back (Latrodectus). Both of those have caused human deaths, but only a minute proportion of Australia’s spiders are dangerous. Antivenins are available for the venoms of both spiders and snakes.
                        <br><br>
                        Ticks and internal parasitic worms are mainly harmful to stock and domestic pets, and some blood-sucking insects are disease carriers. The larvae of the sheep blowfly Lucilia attack sheep and cause losses worth millions of dollars to the wool industry. Locusts, weevils, and insect larvae of various sorts do great damage in agriculture.
                        <br><br>
                        The Australian fauna (and that of New Guinea, which is part of the Australian lithospheric plate) is markedly different from that of the other adjacent land areas (Indonesia and other nearby islands). It is now known that the difference stems from Australia’s long isolation and northward drift into its present geographic position. Thus, the Australian fauna has been derived to a large degree from the lands with which Australia was in contact when it was part of Gondwana. That part of the fauna derived from Asia, which includes the only extant native placental mammals (rats, mice, bats, and the dingo—the latter probably introduced by Aboriginal people), entered Australia by island-hopping or accidental drifting. As might be expected, flying animals of Asian origin (e.g., bats and birds) reached Australia before the others, and they may have done so soon after Australia separated from Antarctica. Horseshoe bats (family Hipposideridae), which are related to typical Old World forms, appear in the Australian fossil record about 20 million years before the present.
                        <br><br>
                        The Gondwanan component gives the Australian fauna its distinctive character. As is the case in South America, Australia has many species of marsupials, but they radiated more widely in Australia than in South America, coming to occupy virtually all mammalian adaptive niches. Thus, there are marsupial equivalents of moles, anteaters, wolves, flying possums, and antelopes. The only egg-laying mammals in the world—the platypus (genus Ornithorhynchus) and the echidna (Tachyglossus); also the New Guinea long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus)—are Gondwanan as well, but the oldest related fossil is from the Early Cretaceous of central Australia and predates the separation of India from Australia. Until recently it was assumed that placental mammals had not occurred in Australia until they emigrated southward from Asia. Nor was there evidence of distinctively Australian mammal fossils in South America. In 1991, however, the Australian paleontologists Michael Archer, Henk Godthelp, and Suzanne Hand reported finding bats of early Eocene origin (about 55 million years old) and a condylarth-like placental mammal in southeastern Queensland. In the same year, the Argentinian paleontologist Rosendo Pascual announced evidence of a 63-million-year old monotreme from Patagonia in southern Argentina. Pascual and Archer reported it to be strikingly similar to the Australian platypus (genus Obdurodon) of the Middle Miocene (about 15 million years ago).
                        <br><br>
                        Emus and cassowaries, mound builders (megapodes), and parrots are almost certainly of Gondwanan origin, as are the side-necked turtles (family Chelidae). Other examples of animals of Gondwanan origin may be found among reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrate groups. Some, such as earthworms belonging to the nonpheretimoid Megascolescini, occur in Australia and India but not in the other continents derived from Gondwana, implying that those animals occurred in a sector of Gondwana from which both Australia and India were derived.
                        <br><br>
                        The most ancient part of the Australian fauna predates even the formation of Gondwana. For example, the Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus) has its closest relatives among the ancient fossil fauna of Europe, North America, and Asia. Those elements are thought to have evolved between the Cambrian and the Devonian periods. Queensland lungfish are less closely related to the lungfish of Africa and South America (Lepidosirenidae) than to the extinct forms from Asia, Europe, and North America. Some insects, arachnids, onycophorans, land mollusks, and earthworms also are thought to have Pangaean origins. There are rich Australian fossil faunas from those ages, including some of the oldest known vertebrates, Arandaspis, a jawless fish from the Late Ordovician, and superbly preserved armoured fishes and lungfishes from the Devonian.

                    <dd>
                        Antarctica, the world’s southernmost and fifth largest continent. Its landmass is almost wholly covered by a vast ice sheet.Often described as a continent of superlatives, Antarctica is not only the world’s southernmost continent. It is also the world’s highest, driest, windiest, coldest, and iciest continent. Antarctica is about 5.5 million square miles (14.2 million square km) in size, and thick ice covers about 98 percent of the land. The continent is divided into East Antarctica (which is largely composed of a high ice-covered plateau) and West Antarctica (which is largely an ice sheet covering an archipelago of mountainous islands).
                        <br><br>
                        Lying almost concentrically around the South Pole, Antarctica’s name means “opposite to the Arctic.” It would be essentially circular except for the outflaring Antarctic Peninsula, which reaches toward the southern tip of South America (some 600 miles [970 km] away), and for two principal embayments, the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea. These deep embayments of the Southern Ocean make the continent somewhat pear-shaped, dividing it into two unequal-sized parts. East Antarctica lies mostly in the east longitudes and is larger than West Antarctica, which lies wholly in the west longitudes. East and West Antarctica are separated by the approximately 2,100-mile- (about 3,400-km-) long Transantarctic Mountains.
                        <br><br>
                        The continental ice sheet contains approximately 7 million cubic miles (about 29 million cubic km) of ice, representing about 90 percent of the world’s ice and 80 percent of its fresh water. Its average thickness is about 5,900 feet (1,800 metres). Ice shelves, or ice sheets floating on the sea, cover many parts of the Ross and Weddell seas. These shelves—the Ross Ice Shelf and the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf—together with other shelves around the continental margins, fringe about 45 percent of Antarctica. Around the Antarctic coast, shelves, glaciers, and ice sheets continually “calve,” or discharge, icebergs into the seas.
                        <br><br>
                        The continent is a cold dry desert where access to water determines the abundance of life. While the terrestrial ecosystem contains more than a thousand known species of organisms, most of these are microorganisms. Maritime Antarctica—the islands and coasts—supports more life than inland Antarctica, and the surrounding ocean is as rich in life as the land is barren.
                        <br><br>
                        From the late 18th to the mid-20th century, whalers and sealers plied the rich seas that surround the continent. Science then replaced whaling and sealing as the primary year-round human activity in Antarctica. In addition, krill harvesting and other types of commercial fishing in the Southern Ocean expanded from the 1960s onwards. The new millennium saw tourism and (to a lesser extent) biological prospecting (the search for useful chemical compounds and genes in local species) become established sectors of the Antarctic economic landscape.
                        <br><br>
                        Governments mandated many early expeditions—whether ostensibly economic, scientific, or exploratory in character—to make territorial claims. With the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957–58, the present scale of scientific investigation of Antarctica began, and on December 1, 1959, the twelve countries that were active in Antarctica during the IGY signed the Antarctic Treaty. This treaty, which was an unprecedented landmark in diplomacy, preserves the continent for nonmilitary scientific pursuits and placed Antarctica under an international regime that, for the treaty’s duration, holds all territorial claims in place. The treaty bound its members indefinitely, with a review of its provisions possible after 30 years. A subsequent treaty, called the Madrid Protocol (adopted in 1991), prohibited mining, required environmental impact assessments for new activities, and designated the continent as a natural reserve.
                        <br><br>
                        Knowledge about Antarctica has increased greatly since the IGY. Geologists, geophysicists, glaciologists, biologists, and other scientists have mapped and visited all of the continent’s mountain regions. Until the 1970s, scientists relied on ground-based geophysical techniques such as seismic surveys of the Antarctic ice sheets to reveal hidden mountain ranges and peaks. Advances in radar technology since then have resulted in airborne radio-echo sounding systems that can measure ice-thickness, which has enabled scientific teams to make systematic remote surveys of ice-buried terrains. Satellites and other remote-sensing technologies have become key tools in providing mapping data.
                        <br><br>
                        The ice-choked and stormy seas around Antarctica long hindered exploration by wooden-hulled ships. No lands break the relentless force of the prevailing west winds as they race clockwise around the continent, dragging westerly ocean currents along beneath. The southernmost parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans meet the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean, the cold oceanic water mass below 60° S with unique biological and physical characteristics. Early penetration of this Southern Ocean in the search for fur seals led in 1820 to the discovery of the continent. Icebreakers and aircraft now make access relatively easy, although still not without hazard in inclement conditions. In addition, many tourists have visited Antarctica, which has underscored the value of scenic resources in the continent’s economic development.
                        <br><br>
                        The term Antarctic region refers to all area—oceanic, island, and continental—lying in the cold Antarctic climatic zone south of the Antarctic Convergence, an important boundary around 55° S, with little seasonal variability, where warm subtropical waters meet and mix with cold polar waters (see also polar ecosystem). For legal purposes of the Antarctic Treaty, the arbitrary boundary of latitude 60° S is used, south of which lies the Antarctic Treaty Area. The familiar map boundaries of the continent known as Antarctica, defined as the South Polar landmass and all its nonfloating grounded ice, are subject to change with current and future climate change. The continent was ice-free during most of its lengthy geologic history, and there is no reason to believe it will not become so again.

                    <dt><h3>Climate of Antarctica</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd>  
                        The unique weather and climate of Antarctica provide the basis for its familiar appellations—Home of the Blizzard and White Desert. By far the coldest continent, Antarctica has winter temperatures that range from −128.6 °F (−89.2 °C), the world’s lowest recorded temperature, measured at Vostok Station (Russia) on July 21, 1983, on the high inland ice sheet to −76 °F (−60 °C) near sea level. Temperatures vary greatly from place to place, but direct measurements in most places are generally available only for summertime. Only at fixed stations operated since the IGY have year-round measurements been made. Winter temperatures rarely reach as high as 52 °F (11 °C) on the northern Antarctic Peninsula, which, because of its maritime influences, is the warmest part of the continent. Mean temperatures of the coldest months are −4 to −22 °F (−20 to −30 °C) on the coast and −40 to −94 °F (−40 to −70 °C) in the interior, the coldest period on the polar plateau being usually in late August just before the return of the sun. Whereas midsummer temperatures may reach as high as 59 °F (15 °C) on the Antarctic Peninsula, those elsewhere are usually much lower, ranging from a mean of about 32 °F (0 °C) on the coast to between −4 and −31 °F (−20 and −35 °C) in the interior. These temperatures are far lower than those of the Arctic, where monthly means range only from about 32 °F in summer to −31 °F in winter.
                        <br><br>
                        International concern is increasing over the possibility of global warming (an amplification of Earth’s greenhouse effect). The glaciers and ice sheets of Antarctica may document such change, especially in West Antarctica. Average winter temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula have increased by 10.8 °F (6 °C) since 1960, and the disintegration of much of the Larsen Ice Shelf between January 1995 and March 2002 was largely attributed to climatic changes resulting from rising average air temperatures.
                        <br><br>
                        Wind chill—the cooling power of wind on exposed surfaces—is the major debilitating weather factor of Antarctic expeditions. Fierce winds characterize most coastal regions, particularly of East Antarctica, where cold, dense air flows down the steep slopes off interior highlands. Known as katabatic winds, they are a surface flow that may be smooth if of low velocity but that may also become greatly turbulent, sweeping high any loose snow, if a critical velocity is surpassed. This turbulent air may appear suddenly and is responsible for the brief and localized Antarctic “blizzards” during which no snow actually falls and skies above are clear. During one winter at Mirny Station, gusts reached more than 110 miles per hour on seven occasions. At Commonwealth Bay on the Adélie Coast the wind speed averaged 45 miles per hour (20 metres per second). Gusts estimated at between 140 and 155 miles per hour on December 9, 1960, destroyed a Beaver aircraft at Mawson Station on the Mac. Robertson Land coast. Winds on the polar plateau are usually light, with monthly mean velocities at the South Pole ranging from about 9 miles per hour (4 metres per second) in December (summer) to 17 miles per hour (8 metres per second) in June and July (winter).
                        <br><br>
                        The Antarctic atmosphere, because of its low temperature, contains only about one-tenth of the water-vapour concentration found in temperate latitudes. This atmospheric water largely comes from ice-free regions of the Southern Ocean and is transported in the troposphere into Antarctica mostly in the 140° sector (80° E to 140° W) from Wilkes Land to Marie Byrd Land. Most of this water precipitates as snow along the continental margin. Rain is almost unknown. Despite the tremendous volume of potential liquid water stored as ice, Antarctica must be considered one of the world’s great deserts; the average precipitation (liquid water equivalent) is only about 2 inches (50 mm) per year over the polar plateau, though considerably more, perhaps 10 times as much, falls in the coastal belt. Lacking a heavy and protective water-vapour-rich atmospheric layer, which in other areas absorbs and reradiates to Earth long-wave radiation, the Antarctic surface readily loses heat energy into space.

                        Many factors determine Antarctica’s climate, but the primary one is the geometry of the Sun-Earth relationship. The 23.5° axial tilt of Earth to its annual plane of orbit, or ecliptic, around the Sun results in long winter nights and long summer days alternating between both polar regions and causing seasonal variations in climate. On midwinter day, about June 21, the Sun’s rays reach to only 23.5° (not exact, because of refraction) from the South Pole along the latitude of 66.5° S, a line familiarly known as the Antarctic Circle. Although “night” theoretically is six months long at the geographic pole, one month of this actually is a twilight period. Only a few coastal fringes lie north of the Antarctic Circle. The amount of incoming solar radiation, and thus heat, depends additionally on the incident angle of the rays and therefore decreases inversely with latitude to reach a minimum at the geographic poles. These and other factors are essentially the same for both polar regions. The reason for their great climatic difference primarily lies in their reverse distributions of land and sea: the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land, while Antarctica is a continent surrounded by ocean. The Arctic Ocean, a climate-ameliorating heat source, has no counterpart at the South Pole, the great elevation and perpetually reflective snow cover of which instead intensify its polar climate. Moreover, during Antarctic winters, freezing of the surrounding sea effectively more than doubles the size of the continent and removes the oceanic heat source to nearly 1,800 miles from the central polar plateau.
                        <br><br>
                        Outgoing terrestrial radiation greatly exceeds absorbed incoming solar radiation. This loss results in strong surface cooling, giving rise to the characteristic Antarctic temperature inversions in which temperature increases from the surface upward to about 1,000 feet above the surface. About 90 percent of the loss is replaced by atmospheric heat from lower latitudes, and the remainder by latent heat of water-vapour condensation.
                        <br><br>
                        Great cyclonic storms circle Antarctica in endless west-to-east procession, exchanging atmospheric heat to the continent from sources in the Southern Ocean and the southern Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Moist maritime air interacting with cold polar air makes the Southern Ocean in the vicinity of the Polar Front one of the world’s stormiest. Few storms bring snowfalls to interior regions. With few reporting stations, weather prediction has been exceedingly difficult but is now greatly aided by satellite imagery.

                        A major focus of upper atmospheric research in Antarctica is to understand the processes leading to the annual springtime depletion in stratospheric ozone—the “ozone hole.” Ozone depletion has been steadily increasing since it was first detected in 1977. Ozone is destroyed as the result of chemical reactions on the surfaces of particles in polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). These clouds are isolated within an atmospheric circulation pattern known as the “polar vortex,” which develops during the long, cold Antarctic winter. The chemical reactions take place with the arrival of sunlight in spring and are facilitated by the presence of halogens (chlorine and fluorine), which are mostly products of human activity. This process of ozone destruction, which also occurs to a lesser extent in the Arctic, increases the amount of ultraviolet-B radiation reaching Earth’s surface, a type of radiation shown to impair photosynthesis in plants, cause an increase in skin cancer in humans, and damage DNA molecules in living things.

                        Antarctica, and particularly the South Pole, attracts much interest in astronomical and astrophysical studies as well as research on the interactions between the Sun and the upper atmosphere of Earth. The South Pole is a unique astronomical location (a station from which the Sun can be viewed continuously in summer) sitting at a high geomagnetic latitude with unequaled atmospheric clarity. It possesses a thick section of pure material (ice) that can be used as a cosmic particle detector. Automatic geophysical observatories on the high polar plateau now record information on the polar ionosphere and magnetosphere, providing data that are critical to an understanding of Earth’s response to solar activity.
                        <br><br>
                        The Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica (CARA) is a joint project facilitated by the United States and Germany with collaborators in other countries. CARA supports a submillimetre-wave telescope, several other telescopes, and a program to measure the properties of relict radiation left over from the big bang—useful in testing cosmological models.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the most unique astrophysical observatories on Earth is AMANDA, the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array. This involves an array of hundreds of optical devices set at depths of up to 1.2 miles (2 km) in the ice below the South Pole. It is essentially a telescope built within the ice sheet to detect high-energy neutrinos that pass through the Earth from distant sources.

                    <dd>
                        Antarctica provides the best available picture of the probable appearance 20,000 years ago of northern North America under the great Laurentide Ice Sheet. Some scientists contend that the initial glacier that thickened over time to become the vast East Antarctic Ice Sheet originated in the Gamburtsev Mountains more than 14 million years ago. Other glaciers, such as those forming in the Sentinel Range perhaps as early as 50 million years ago, advanced down valleys to calve into the sea in West Antarctica. Fringing ice shelves were built and later became grounded as glaciation intensified. Local ice caps developed, covering West Antarctic island groups as well as the mountain ranges of East Antarctica. The ice caps eventually coalesced into great ice sheets that tied together West and East Antarctica into the single continent that is known today. Except for a possible major deglaciation as recently as 3 million years ago, the continent has been largely covered by ice since the first glaciers appeared.
                        <br><br>
                        Causal factors leading to the birth and development of these continental ice sheets and then to their decay and death are, nevertheless, still poorly understood. The factors are complexly interrelated. Moreover, once developed, ice sheets tend to form independent climatic patterns and thus to be self-perpetuating and eventually perhaps even self-destructing. Cold air masses draining off Antarctic lands, for example, cool and freeze surrounding oceans in winter to form an ice pack, which reduces solar energy input by increasing reflectivity and makes interior continental regions even more remote from sources of open oceanic heat and moisture. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet has grown to such great elevation and extent that little atmospheric moisture now nourishes its central part.
                        <br><br>
                        The volume of South Polar ice must have fluctuated greatly at times since the birth of the ice sheets. Glacial erratics and glacially striated rocks on mountain summits now high above current ice-sheet levels testify to an overriding by ice at much higher levels. General lowering of levels caused some former glaciers flowing from the polar region through the Transantarctic Mountains to recede and nearly vanish, producing such spectacular “dry valleys” as the Wright, Taylor, and Victoria valleys near McMurdo Sound. Doubt has been shed on the common belief that Antarctic ice has continuously persisted since its origin by the discovery reported in 1983 of Cenozoic marine diatoms—believed to date from the Pliocene Epoch (about 5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago)—in glacial till of the Beardmore Glacier area. The diatoms are believed to have been scoured from young sedimentary deposits of basins in East Antarctica and incorporated into deposits of glaciers moving through the Transantarctic Mountains. If so, Antarctica may have been free or nearly free of ice as recently as about 3 million years ago, when the diatom-bearing beds were deposited in a marine seaway, and the Antarctic Ice Sheet may have undergone deglaciations perhaps similar to those that occurred later during interglacial stages in the Northern Hemisphere. Evidence of former higher sea levels found in many areas of the Earth seems to support the hypothesis that such deglaciation occurred. If Antarctica’s ice were to melt today, for example, global sea levels would probably rise about 150 to 200 feet (45 to 60 metres).
                        <br><br>
                        The Antarctic Ice Sheet seems to be approximately in a state of equilibrium, neither increasing nor decreasing significantly according to the best estimates. Snow precipitation is offset mainly by continental ice moving seaward by three mechanisms—ice-shelf flow, ice-stream flow, and sheet flow. The greatest volume loss is by calving from ice shelves, particularly the Ross, Ronne, Filchner, and Amery ice shelves. Much loss also occurs by bottom melting, but this is partly compensated by a gain in mass by accretion of frozen seawater. The quantitative pattern and the balance between gain and loss are known to be different at different ice shelves, but melting probably predominates. The smaller ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula are currently retreating, breaking up into vast fields of icebergs, likely due to rising temperature and surface melting.
                        <br><br>
                        The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has been the subject of much recent research because it may be unstable. The Ross Ice Shelf is largely fed by huge ice streams descending from the WAIS along the Siple Coast. These ice streams have shown major changes—acceleration, deceleration, thickening, and thinning—in the last century or so. These alterations have affected the grounding line, where grounded glaciers lift off their beds to form ice shelves or floating glacier tongues. Changes to the grounding line may eventually transform the WAIS proper, potentially leading to removal of this ice sheet and causing a major rise in global sea level. Although the possibility of all this happening in the next 100 years is remote, major modifications in the WAIS in the 21st century are not impossible and could have worldwide effects.
                        <br><br>
                        These ice sheets also provide unique records of past climates from atmospheric, volcanic, and cosmic fallout; precipitation amounts and chemistry; temperatures; and even samples of past atmospheres. Thus ice-core drilling, and the subsequent analysis of these cores, has provided new information on the processes that cause climate to change. A deep coring hole at the Russian station Vostok brought up a climate and fallout history extending back more than 400,000 years. A huge freshwater lake lies between the ice and the bed at this location. Lake Vostok has probably been isolated from the atmosphere for tens of millions of years, leading to speculation of what sort of life may have evolved in this unusual setting. Lake Vostok has also attracted the attention of the planetary science community because it is a possible test site for future study of Jupiter’s moon Europa, which possesses a layer of liquid water beneath a thick ice cover and thus has a potential for harbouring life.

                        Thousands of meteorites have been discovered on “blue ice” areas of the ice sheets. Only five fragments had been found by 1969, but since then more than 9,800 have been recovered, mainly by Japanese and American scientists. Most specimens appear to have landed on Antarctic ice sheets between about 700,000 and 10,000 years ago. They were carried to blue ice areas near mountains where the ancient ice ablated and meteorites became concentrated on the surface. Most meteorites are believed to be from asteroids and a few from comets, but some are now known to be of lunar origin. Other meteorites of a rare class called shergottites had a similar origin from Mars.

                    <dd>
                        The cold desert climate of Antarctica supports only an impoverished community of cold-tolerant land plants that are capable of surviving lengthy winter periods of total or near-total darkness during which photosynthesis cannot take place. Growth must occur in short summer bursts lasting only a few days, a few weeks, or a month or two, depending upon such diverse factors as latitude, seasonal snowpacks, elevation, topographic orientation, wind, and moisture, in both the substrate and the atmosphere. Moisture is the most important single variable and is provided mainly by atmospheric water vapour and by local melt supplies from fallen snow, drift snow, and permafrost. Stream runoff is exceedingly rare. Extreme cold, high winds, and aridity inhibit growth even in summer in most areas. There are, however, certain areas at high latitude and high elevation that have local microclimates formed by differential solar heating of dark surfaces (see also albedo), and these areas are able to support life. The importance of such microclimates was demonstrated by the second Byrd Antarctic Expedition (1933–35), which found that lichens in Marie Byrd Land grow preferentially on darker-coloured heat-absorbing rock.
                        <br><br>
                        Antarctic plants total about 800 species, of which 350 are lichens. Lichens, although slow-growing, are particularly well adapted to Antarctic survival. They can endure lengthy high-stress periods in dormancy and almost instantly become photosynthetic when conditions improve. Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), totaling about 100 species, predominate in maritime regions, but mosses can grow nearly everywhere that lichens grow. Liverworts are reported only from coastal and maritime regions. Numerous species of molds, yeasts, and other fungi, as well as freshwater algae and bacteria, complete the listing of Antarctic plants. These forms are extremely widespread and are reported as far as latitude 87° S. In addition, Antarctic seas are highly productive in plankton plant life, particularly in near-shore, nutrient-rich zones of upwelling. Diatoms, a type of algae, are especially abundant.
                        <br><br>
                        Although soils are essentially not of humic type, they commonly are not sterile either, in that they may contain such microorganisms as bacteria or a variety of blue-green algae. The blue-green algae Nostoc locally contribute minor organic compounds to soils.
                        <br><br>
                        Today’s barren Antarctic landscape little resembles ancient Paleozoic and Mesozoic ones with their far greater floral displays. Antarctic glaciation, probably beginning 50 million years ago, forced the northward migration of all vascular plants (ferns, conifers, and flowering plants). Only nonwoody forms have again populated subantarctic regions and have scarcely repenetrated the Antarctic zone.
                        <br><br>
                        Unlike Antarctica, lying south of the Antarctic Convergence, the islands north of the Convergence in the subantarctic botanical zone—including the South Georgia, Crozet, Kerguelen, and Macquarie islands—are characterized by an abundance of vascular plants of many species, at least 50 being identified on South Georgia alone. Whereas plants reproducing by spores are characteristic of Antarctica, seed plants chiefly characterize subantarctic regions.
                        <br><br>
                        Humans have greatly influenced the natural ecosystem in many Antarctic and subantarctic regions. Alien species of vascular plants near whaling stations have been introduced, and doubtless many alien microorganisms exist near all Antarctic stations. Alien herbivores, chiefly sheep and rabbits, have decimated plant communities on many subantarctic islands. Rabbits have exterminated the native cabbage (or Kerguelen cabbage, Pringlea antiscorbutica) over wide areas on Kerguelen, and sheep have decimated tussock communities on South Georgia. Increasing numbers of tourists will have an impact on Antarctica’s fragile ecosystem.

                    <dd>
                        The native land fauna is wholly invertebrate. Apparently climatically less tolerant and less easily dispersed, the fauna follows plant colonization of newly deglaciated regions and therefore is not as widely distributed. The Antarctic microfauna includes heliozoans, rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes, and ciliate protozoans. The protozoans dominate soil and freshwater communities. The terrestrial macrofauna consists entirely of arthropods, many species being parasitic on birds and seals. The principal arthropod groups represented include Acarina (mites), Mallophaga (biting lice), Collembola (springtails), Anoplura (sucking lice), Diptera (midges), and Siphonaptera (fleas). Two species of beetles, probably alien, are known from islands near the Antarctic Peninsula. The dominant free-living forms, mites and springtails, live under stones and are associated with spore-reproducing plants.

                    <dt><h3>Birds</h3></dt><br/>
                    <dd> 
                        About 45 species of birds live south of the Antarctic Convergence, but only three—the emperor penguin, Antarctic petrel, and South Polar (McCormick’s) skua—breed exclusively on the continent or on nearby islands. An absence of mammalian land predators and the rich offshore food supply make Antarctic coasts a haven for immense seabird rookeries. Penguins, of the order Sphenisciformes, symbolize this polar region, though they live on seacoasts throughout the Southern Hemisphere. Of the 18 living species, only the Adélie and emperor live along the Antarctic coastline. The habitats of five other polar species—king, chinstrap, gentoo, rockhopper, and macaroni—extend only as far south as the northern Antarctic Peninsula and subantarctic islands. The evolution of these flightless birds has been traced to the Eocene Epoch, about 40 million years ago, using fossils found on Seymour Island, off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, and at a few other places. The largest modern penguin, the emperor, standing between 3 and 4 feet (0.9 and 1.2 metres) tall, would be dwarfed by some of its extinct New Zealand and Seymour Island relatives, the fossil bones of which indicate that they reached heights up to 5.6 feet (1.7 metres). Some authorities believe that penguins may have a shared ancestry with other birds of Antarctica, capable of flight, from the order Procellariiformes. Birds of that order, mainly species of petrels but also a few of albatrosses, make up more than half of the Antarctic and subantarctic breeding species. Other birds of the region include species of cormorants, pintails, gulls, terns, sheathbills, and pipits.
                        <br><br>
                        Banding and recovery studies show that some Antarctic birds travel throughout the world. Rare sightings of skuas and petrels far in the continental interior, even near the South Pole, suggest that these powerful birds may occasionally cross the continent. Experiments show that Antarctic birds, including the flightless penguin, have strong homing instincts and excellent navigational capability; they apparently have a highly developed sun-azimuth orientation system and biological clock mechanism that functions even with the sun remaining continuously high. Adélie penguins released as far as 1,900 miles from their nests, for example, are known to have returned within a year.
                        <br><br>
                        Feeding habits vary widely from species to species. Most depend on the abundantly provisioned larder of the sea. The seabirds feed mainly on crustacea, fish, and squid, mostly at the surface or, in the case of cormorants and penguins, at depths down to about 150 feet. Shorebirds forage for mollusks, echinoderms, and littoral crustacea. Sheathbills, the southern black-backed gull, giant petrels, and skuas feed occasionally, as allowed, on other birds’ unguarded eggs. The voracious skua and giant petrel are even known to attack the young or weak of other species, particularly penguins.
                        <br><br>
                        Dependent upon seafood, most birds leave the continent each autumn and follow Antarctica’s “secondary” coastline as the ice pack builds northward. The emperor penguins, however, are the exception, remaining behind as solitary guardians (other than humans) of the continent through the long winter night. The emperors, once thought rare, number about 600,000 birds in more than 40 known colonies.

                        The prolific zooplankton of Antarctic waters feed on the copious phytoplankton and, in turn, form the basic diet of whales, seals, fish, squid, and seabirds. The Antarctic waters, because of their upwelled nutrients, are more than seven times as productive as subantarctic waters. The most important organism in the higher food chain is the small, shrimplike krill, Euphausia superba, only an inch or two in length when mature. But for their habit of congregating in vast, dense schools, they would have little food value for the large whales and seals. Their densities are great, however, and a whale, with built-in nets of baleen and hairlike fibres, can strain out meals of a ton or more in a few minutes. During the three to four months spent in Antarctic waters, the original population of baleen whales alone could consume an estimated 150 million short tons (about 136 million metric tons) of krill. Animals on the sea bottom of the nearshore zone include the sessile hydrozoans (see also cnidarian), corals, sponges, and bryozoans, as well as the foraging crablike pycnogonids and isopods, the annelid worm polychaeta, echinoids, sea stars (starfish), and a variety of crustaceans and mollusks. Winter and anchor ice, however, keep the sublittoral zone (the permanently submerged region of the marine environment) relatively barren to about 50 feet (15.2 metres) in depth.
                        <br><br>
                        Of the nearly 30,000 species of modern fish, no more than about 100 are known from seas south of the Antarctic Convergence. Nearly three-fourths of the 90 or so sea-bottom species belong to the superfamily Notothenioidea, the Antarctic perches. At sea bottom there are also the Zoarcidae, or eel-pouts; the Liparidae, or sea snails; the Macrouridae, or rat-tailed fishes; and the Gadidae, or codlike fishes. Rare nonbony types in the Antarctic zone include hagfish and skates. Many species of deep-sea fish are known south of the Antarctic Convergence, but only three, a barracuda and two lantern fishes, seem to be confined to this zone. Antarctic fishes are well adapted to the cold waters; the bottom fish are highly endemic, 90 percent of the species being found nowhere else. This supports other biological and geologic evidence that Antarctica has been isolated for a very long time.
                        <br><br>
                        Antarctic native mammals are all marine and include seals (pinnipeds), porpoises, dolphins, and whales (cetaceans). Only one otariid, or fur seal, breeds south of the Antarctic Convergence; four species of phocids, or true seals—the gregarious Weddell seal, the ubiquitous crabeater seal, the solitary and aggressively carnivorous leopard seal, and the rarely seen Ross seal—breed almost exclusively in the Antarctic zone, and another, the southern elephant seal, breeds near the Convergence at South Georgia, Kerguelen, and Macquarie islands. The sea lion, an otariid, is plentiful in the Falkland Islands but probably never ventures into the cold Antarctic waters. The fur seal and the elephant seal are now regenerating after near extinction. Weddell seals are thought to number about 1,000,000, the crabeater about 8,000,000, and the Ross seals between 50,000 and 220,000. Weddell seals are unique in being able to survive under fast ice, even in winter, by maintaining open breathing holes with their teeth. The leopard seal, armed with powerful jaws and huge canines, is one of the few predators of adult penguins. A number of mummified seal carcasses, chiefly crabeaters, have been found at distances of nearly 30 miles (48.2 km) from the sea and at elevations up to about 3,000 feet (914 metres) in the McMurdo dry valleys. Finding no food in such inland wanderings, the crabeaters eventually died, and their leathery carcasses were preserved by the coldness and aridity of the climate.
                        <br><br>
                        Whales and their cetacean relatives, porpoises and dolphins, range widely from Arctic to Antarctic waters and are found in all oceans and seas. A number of species range to, but generally not across, the Antarctic Convergence and so are considered only peripheral Antarctic types. Among the fish- and squid-eating toothed whales, or odontocetes, are a few peripheral Antarctic porpoises and dolphins and the pilot whale. More typical of Antarctic waters are the killer whale, sperm whale, and rare bottle-nosed, or beaked, whale. Seven species of baleen, or whalebone, whales also inhabit Antarctic waters, subsisting on the plentiful krill; these include the southern right whale, the humpback whale, and four kinds of rorqual—the blue whale, fin whale, sei whale, and lesser rorqual, or minke. The pygmy right whale is endemic to Antarctic and subantarctic waters. The killer whale, one of the most intelligent of marine animals, hunts in packs and feeds on larger animals, such as fish, penguins and other aquatic birds, seals, dolphins, and other whales. Despite its name, there have been no authenticated accounts of attacks on humans near Antarctica. Excessive slaughter in the past has drastically decimated stocks of the larger whales, particularly the giant blue whales. Near extinction, the blue whales have been protected by international agreement.

                        Alien mammals that now reside semipermanently in Antarctic and subantarctic regions include sheep, rabbits, dogs, cats, rats, mice, and human beings. Effects on local ecosystems are great, from pollution of station areas by human wastes to erosion from overgrazing by sheep and to decimation of bird populations by dogs and cats and of whale and fur-seal stocks by humans. Even so, Antarctica remains by far the least contaminated land on Earth. Under the Antarctic Treaty, it is designated as a special conservation area, and many former human activities have been prohibited in an attempt to preserve the natural ecological system of the unique environment.
